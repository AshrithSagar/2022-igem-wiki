  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><b>GRASP</b>- Generating random alanine scanned peptides is a peptide mutator that performs conserved substitutions based on inputs from an alanine scan. This was a crucial step in significantly increasing the scope of possible mutations. Existing softwares in the domain only considers surface-level information, ignoring any conformational changes that may occur. Grasp creates combinations of conserved substitutions on selected amino acids that fall within the specified range. Then, five random sequences are chosen from the sample set created. These are then tested and subjected to further analysis. Thus, our software is a one-of-a-kind approach to automating and exponentially simplifying the process of random conserved mutations. This process can be employed to potentially increase the affinity of the peptide to its interacting ligands. </p>

        sequences.</span></em>
  </p>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p><span>The software mainly comprises of the following modules:</span></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong><span>Alanine Scan  \( \Delta \Delta G \) values</span></strong>
        <span>BUDE Alanine scan is employed to obtain  \( \Delta \Delta G \) values of each residue present in the input.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong><span>Conservative mutations</span></strong></p>
      <p><span>Conserved mutation is a process in which mutations are made within the same type of residues.</span>
      </p>
      <p><em><span>For example</span></em><span>: Hydrophobic residues are replaced by hydrophobic residues. In our
          case we delved deeper into this by replacing it w.r.t to charge as well.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong><span>Random sampler</span></strong>
        <span>We select certain samples from the huge sequence list recieved as the output to reduce users work
          load. The selection happening is completely random.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3><span>Features</span></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong><span>Command Line Interface (CLI)</span></strong>
        <span>We can use the software locally on command prompt.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong><span>Integrable modules</span></strong></p>
      <p><span>While running the software we can include different functions and libraries of python and basically
          run the software on different python environments.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong><span>Mutation lock</span></strong>
        <span>To prevent the remutation of an already modified residue we put that part of the sequence into a
          mutation lock.</span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong><span>Aggrescan</span></strong></p>
      <p><span>A BASH scipt is been included which takes the output and prepends FASTA headers to each sequence in
          the text file.</span></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3><span>Background</span></h3>
  <p><span>Protein engineering is the process of modifying a protein through substitution, Insertion, or deletion so
      that it can exhibit certain characteristics and properties that we desire. During the process of designing our
      peptide, we came across the problem of having a very large sample set of substitutions through trial and
      error. However, even after this we could not guarantee an increase in affinity as compared to the original
      peptide as needed in our case. To overcome this problem, we designed this software which will provide all the
      most probable mutations that increase the binding affinity.</span></p>
  <p><span>Furthermore, we explored other point mutation softwares for our problem; however, they only took surface
      information into consideration. We decided to take  \( \Delta \Delta G \) value of a residue as the parameter for mutation which
      give an increase in the accuracy of the mutation.</span></p>

  <h3>Method</h3>

  <h4> \( \Delta \Delta G \) threshold</h4>
  <p>
    We take  \( \Delta \Delta G \)value of each residue derived from BUDE alanine scan as a parameter to do mutations. To make these
    mutations we set a threshold  \( \Delta \Delta G \)range for each residue (in our case, 0 to 1). Only if the  \( \Delta \Delta G \) value lies between
    this
    range will it be mutated.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Significance of Cartesian product
  </h3>
  <p>
    Cartesian Product: The Cartesian Product of sets \(A\) and \(B\) is defined as the set of all ordered pairs \((x, y)\)
    such
    that \(x\) belongs to \(A\)and \(y\) belongs to \(B\)
    For example, if \(A = {1, 2}\) and \(B = {3, 4, 5}\), then the Cartesian Product of A and B is \({(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}\).
    Originally, during a test run, the computational time that the software took for making 3 mutation positions was 2
    hours 20 mins.
    After incorporating the cartesian product into the mutator, the time reduced to 11 mutation positions in 10 seconds.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Algorithm
  </h3>
  <p>
    We first create a Mutater object, which support the following three formats:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Wild type amino acid, the position of the Amino acid, and the Mutant type it needs to be replaced with.
    </li>
    <li>
      Just the Wild type amino acid and its position, without the Mutant type. This can act as the template to create
      new
      Mutater objects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Just the position in the sequence.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    Alanine scanning
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Alanine scanning results from BUDE Alanine scan are parsed through which results in a position array over which
    mutations are possibly required.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Group mutations
  </h3>
  <p>
    The sequence is taken as a template over which a special array is constructed, with the following steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Iterate over the sequence and get the wild type amino acid at each stage.
    </li>
    <li>
      Retain the wild type if mutation isn't required at this position. This could result when the position doesn't want
      to
      be mutated, or when the position is present in the mutation lock array.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a mutation is required in the current position, replace the position with an array of all the possible amino
      acids
      within the same group. This step is important to achieve Conserved mutations.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    Cartesian product
  </h3>
  <p>
    The special array is then passed to the itertools.product() function, which evaluates the Cartesian product on the
    elements of the special array. This results in an iterable object that contains all the final sequences, which is
    then
    stored in the text file.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Random sample
  </h3>
  <p>
    A trivial random sampler is implemented using random.sample() on the sequences array, and then stored in a text
    file.
  </p>
