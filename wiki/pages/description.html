  <p>Fish has continued to be a vital part of our diet since ancient times. The annual fish consumption has increased not only in India but around the globe as well. This has led to the development of an extensive aquaculture industry. Unfortunately, excessive industrialisation procedures, over-intensive exploitation, and poor management have resulted in significant bacterial disease epidemics in aquaculture. These bacteria can be transmitted by consuming raw or undercooked fish that are infected and can lead to severe symptoms in humans, including but not limited to vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. To mitigate this issue, it is vital to target the infection cycle in its early stages to prevent the bacteria from infecting the fish.

  <h2>The problem</h2>

  <p>One of the most prevalent bacterial infections affecting various marine fish and shellfish is vibriosis. It leads
    to significant economic losses and affects multiple sectors, thus hindering the development of the country. Several
    Vibrionaceae species have been linked to vibriosis in marine animals. According to a recent study, the most
    prevalent species triggering vibriosis in aquaculture farms are <i>V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi,
    V. owensii</i>, and <i>V. campbelli</i>. The pathogenicity of these species is aided by a wide range of virulence factors,
    which allows them to infect a wide range of hosts [1].</p>


  <p>In humans, vibriosis results in acute gastroenteritis after consuming raw, undercooked, or improperly handled marine food. Occasionally, cases of septicaemia, ear infections, or wound infections in people who already have medical issues are seen [2]. In fish, vibriosis exhibits symptoms like fatigue and necrosis of the skin and appendages, which causes body malformations, delayed development, liquefaction of internal organs, blindness, opacity of the muscles, and eventual death [1].  
</p>

<p>Our bacteria of interest to tackle this infection in fish is V.parahaemolyticus. It is a gram-negative halophile that is found in estuarine and marine environments [2]. V. parahaemolyticus consists of a novel adhesion factor called Multivalent Adhesion Molecule 7 (MAM7)—a surface protein present on the bacteria. It is responsible for the initial host-pathogen adhesion and can trigger the upregulation of additional adhesins and virulence factors unique to the pathogen and the host cell. MAM7 forms a tripartite complex with the protein, Fibronectin (Fn), and the ligand, phosphatidic acid (PA). It has been extensively studied in V. parahaemolyticus, and hence, it deemed fit for our project’s research[3].
</p>

  <h2>Why MAM7?
  </h2>
  <p>Several virulence factors including hemolysin, type III secretion system, type VI secretion system, adhesion factor, iron uptake system, lipopolysaccharide, protease and outer membrane proteins [4] have been identified in V. parahaemolyticus that lead to the onset of vibriosis; this increases the potential targets for inhibition. Most of these factors require direct contact between the pathogen and the host cell to induce the infection cycle. Studies have shown that the expression of MAM7 leads to rapid contact when it is first exposed to the bacteria and can cause increased expression of additional, pathogen and host cell-specific, adhesion molecules and virulents. 
  </p>
  <p>Elimination of this protein from V. parahaemolyticus causes the general reduction in host cell cytotoxicity and a lag in its outset [3]. The host cell, which in our case is fish, consist of Phosphatidic acid (PA) and Fibronectin (Fn) as its interacting ligands, present in the extracellular matrix. When the bacteria V. parahaemolyticus is in the vicinity of the host cell,  MAM7 present on its surface interacts with the ligands. Binding to PA and Fn is not mutually exclusive; rather, it forms a tripartite complex of MAM7, PA, and Fn [3]. The adhesion of the bacteria, which is the primary step involved in infection, triggers the process of biofilm formation, further leading to cytotoxicity and haemolysis. In addition to its role in adhesion, MAM7 is involved in host cell signalling pathways that eventually lead to the breaching of the epithelial cell barrier [5].

  <h2>Current solutions
  </h2>
  <p>Currently, there are multiple solutions to this infection; however, antibiotics still remain to be the most popular strategy for treating and preventing the disease in fish. Antibiotics are frequently used with fish diets or baths to treat bacterial illnesses in real life. Antibiotic overuse has led to the emergence of multidrug resistance in several pathogenic bacteria, including the Vibrio spp. [6]. Every year, millions of fish are vaccinated to combat the problem of antibiotic resistance. Though compared to antibiotics, vaccines are a better prevention strategy, they have their drawbacks. Commercial vaccines are not economical and labour and time intensive. Every method of inoculation of these vaccines have their disadvantages. The efficacy of an oral vaccine is low due to the degradation of the antigens present in the vaccines. Immersion vaccines require a large quantity of the vaccine. Furthermore, they are not efficient and provide immunity for a short period. As for the injection vaccines, they are not suitable for fish that are small in size. Moreover, the fish also need to be starved and anaesthetised for their protection which is detrimental to the fish [7].

  <h2>Our solution
  </h2>
  <p>Our solution involves the synthesis of a novel antimicrobial peptide that will bind to MAM7 and prevent the bacteria from adhering to the cell surface, thereby inhibiting the progression of vibriosis. The antimicrobial peptide will be created by mimicking the structure of fibronectin since it has a higher affinity for MAM7 compared to PA. To deliver our peptide, it  will be encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles. Using chitosan nanoparticles for the delivery will be an asset to AMPifin since they are proven to have immunoregulatory properties in fish.  Our peptide is more preferable when compared with the current solutions because it does not lead to antibiotic resistance and is sustainable. Furthermore it does not disrupt the microbiota of the ecosystem and is biodegradable. Since it is synthesised to bind to MAM7, AMPifin can be a potential broad-spectrum solution against all gram-negative pathogenic bacteria that use MAM7 as their adhesion protein.
