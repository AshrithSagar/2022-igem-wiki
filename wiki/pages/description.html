  <p>Fish has continued to be a vital part of our diet since ancient times. The annual fish consumption has increased
    not only in India but around the globe as well. This has led to the development of an extensive pisciculture
    industry. Unfortunately, excessive industrialisation procedures, over-intensive exploitation, and poor management
    have resulted in significant bacterial disease epidemics in pisciculture. These bacteria can be transmitted by
    consuming raw or undercooked fish that are infected and can lead to severe symptoms in humans, including but not
    limited to vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. To mitigate this issue, it is vital to target the infection cycle
    in its early stages to prevent the bacteria from infecting the fish.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>One of the most prevalent bacterial infections affecting various marine fish and shellfish is vibriosis.
  Vibriosis
  is a serious diseases of fish, crustaceans and shellfish as recognised by the FAO, United Nations. It leads to
  significant economic losses and affects multiple sectors, thus hindering the development of the country.In a study
  of Epinephelus spp. approximately 66.7% of diseases reported were vibriosis. Several Vibrionaceae species have
  been
  linked to vibriosis in marine animals. According to a recent study, the most prevalent species triggering
  vibriosis
  in aquaculture farms are <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio owensii, and
    Vibrio campbelli</i>. The pathogenicity of these species is aided by a wide range of virulence factors, which
  allows them to infect a wide range of hosts [1].
</p>

<p>In humans, vibriosis results in acute gastroenteritis after consuming raw, undercooked, or improperly handled
  marine food. Occasionally, cases of septicaemia, ear infections, or wound infections in people who already have
  medical issues are seen [2]. In fish, vibriosis exhibits symptoms like fatigue and necrosis of the skin and
  appendages, which causes body malformations, delayed development, liquefaction of internal organs, blindness,
  opacity of the muscles, and eventual death. Vibriosis affects all stages of growth leading to upto even 50%
  mortality.[1]

<p>Our bacteria of interest to tackle this infection in fish is <em>V.parahaemolyticus</em>. It is a gram-negative
  halophile that is found in estuarine and marine environments [2]. <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> consists of a novel
  adhesion factor called Multivalent Adhesion Molecule 7 (MAM7)—a surface protein present on the bacteria. It is
  responsible for the initial host-pathogen adhesion and can trigger the upregulation of additional adhesins and
  virulence factors unique to the pathogen and the host cell. MAM7 forms a tripartite complex with the
  protein—Fibronectin (Fn), and the ligand—Phosphatidic acid (PA). It has been extensively studied in <i>V.
    parahaemolyticus</i>, and hence, it deemed fit for our project's research [3].
</p>

  <h2>Why MAM7?</h2>
  <p>Several virulence factors including hemolysin, type III secretion system, type VI secretion system, adhesion
    factor, iron uptake system, lipopolysaccharide, protease and outer membrane proteins [4] have been identified in
    <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> that lead to the onset of vibriosis, consequently increasing the potential targets for
    inhibition. Most of these factors require direct contact between the pathogen and the host cell to induce the
    infection cycle. Studies have shown that the expression of MAM7 leads to rapid contact when it is first exposed to
    the bacteria and can cause increased expression of additional, pathogen and host cell-specific, adhesion molecules
    and virulents.
  </p>
  <p>Elimination of this protein from <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> causes the general reduction in host cell cytotoxicity
    and a lag in its outset [3]. The host cell, which in our case is fish, consist of Phosphatidic acid (PA) and
    Fibronectin (Fn) as its interacting ligands, present in the extracellular matrix. When the bacteria <i>V.
      parahaemolyticus</i> is in the vicinity of the host cell, MAM7 present on its surface interacts with the ligands.
    Binding to PA and Fn is not mutually exclusive; rather, it forms a tripartite complex of MAM7, PA, and Fn [3]. The
    adhesion of the bacteria, which is the primary step involved in infection, triggers the process of biofilm
    formation, further leading to cytotoxicity and haemolysis. In addition to its role in adhesion, MAM7 is involved in
    host cell signalling pathways that eventually lead to breaching of the epithelial cell barrier [5].

  <h2>Current solutions</h2>
  <p>Currently, there are multiple solutions to this infection; however, antibiotics still remain to be the most popular
    strategy for treating and preventing the disease in fish. Antibiotics are frequently used with fish diets or baths
    to treat bacterial illnesses in real life. Antibiotic overuse has led to the emergence of multidrug resistance in
    several pathogenic bacteria, including the <i>Vibrio</i> spp. [6]. Every year, millions of fish are vaccinated to
    combat the problem of antibiotic resistance. Albeit compared to antibiotics, vaccines are a better prevention
    strategy, they have their drawbacks. Commercial vaccines are uneconomical and labour-intensive. Furthermore, there
    are challenges when it comes to the inoculation of these vacccines. The efficacy of oral vaccines is low due to the
    degradation of the antigens present in the vaccines. Immersion vaccines require a large quantity of the vaccine.
    Furthermore, they are not efficient and provide immunity for a short period. As for the injection vaccines, they are
    not suitable for fish that are small in size. Moreover, the fish also need to be starved and anaesthetised for their
    protection which is detrimental to them [7].

<h2>Our solution</h2>
<p>Our solution involves the synthesis of a novel antimicrobial peptide that will bind to MAM7 and prevent the
  bacteria from adhering to the cell surface, thereby inhibiting the progression of vibriosis. The antimicrobial
  peptide will be created by mimicking the structure of fibronectin.The peptide will be produced using the
  pET-22b(+)
  vector system and BL21 as our chassis. To deliver our peptide, it will be encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles.
  Using chitosan nanoparticles for the delivery will be an asset to AMPifin since they are proven to have
  immunoregulatory properties in fish. For more information on the design and the methods of peptide production and
  delivery, refer to our design page.(*insert link for design*). Our peptide is preferable when compared to current
  solutions because it is unlikely to induce antibiotic resistance and is sustainable. Furthermore it does not
  disrupt
  the microbiota of the ecosystem and is biodegradable. Since, MAM7 is present in several pathogenic gram negative
  bacteria, AMPifin can be a potential broad-spectrum solution against bacteria that use MAM7 as their adhesion
  protein.
