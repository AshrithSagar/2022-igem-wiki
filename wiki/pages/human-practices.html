      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>One of the most prevalent bacterial infections affecting various marine fish and shellfish is vibriosis.
        Vibriosis is a serious disease in fish, crustaceans and shellfish as recognised by the FAO, United Nations. It
        leads to significant economic losses and affects multiple sectors, thus hindering the development of the
        country. According to a recent study, the most prevalent species triggering vibriosis in aquaculture farms are
        <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio owensii, and Vibrio campbelli</i>. The
        pathogenicity of these species is aided by a wide range of virulence factors, which allows them to infect a
        wide range of hosts [1].
      </p>

      <p>Our aim through AMPifin is to improve pisciculture operations, and consequently increase the yield of fish in
        the market—a major part of various Indian states’ staple diets. This approach would immensely benefit the
        economy and fisherfolk by facilitating a sustainable pisciculture industry. AMPifin is a sustainable solution to
        vibriosis in fish. In line with our project’s work, we carried out extensive work concerning human practices.
      </p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>

      <p>The idea for the project provided us with a plethora of possibilities, but our literature research and
        responsibility toward the marine populations reiterated our sense of commitment to prioritise a sustainable
        approach through our solution. Nevertheless, we encountered numerous challenges during our ideation, research,
        and experimentation process. We considered how our team could cushion the pisciculture industry. We knew that
        for our initiative to be successful, we needed to combine and maximise the best aspects of our core values,
        scientific reasoning, and community involvement.</p>
      <h2>Solutions</h2>

      <p>During the initial stages of our project, we talked to a fish farm owner who introduced us to the disease
        Vibriosis. We discovered that <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> is the causative bacteria. Our project’s work began
        by interacting with an expert in the field of computational biology who guided us on the engineering and
        designing aspects of our peptide. Through continuous interactions, we received the idea of mimicking
        fibronectin. As we progressed, we met with some experts who stressed the imperativeness of biosafety aspects and
        guided us toward a safe delivery mechanism—i.e., implementing chitosan nanoparticle encapsulation instead of
        bacterial encapsulation. Moreover, they drew our attention to the possible side effects of biomagnification;
        hence, we ran a toxicity and allergen test on our peptide. As AMPifin came together, we interacted with numerous
        stakeholders and introduced them to our solution. Through our correspondence, we established a connection with
        an all-inclusive demographic.</p>

      <h2>Stakeholder approach</h2>

      <p>We received numerous comments and ideas after holding several meetings and conversations with specialists,
        researchers, professors, and farmers. These conversations provided valuable feedback that improved the areas we
        overlooked in our project and recommended strategies to speed up its development. Without these interactionss,
        AMPifin would be considerably different. To better our approach at each stage, we engaged in a fruitful dialogue
        with various stakeholders. We conversed with multiple industry specialists, academia, the general public,
        students, and our project's target consumer—the fisherfolk. This paved the way for our project's advancement,
        and helped us reflect on AMPifin's objectives effectively. It enabled us to identify the many issues or flaws in
        our project and identify better solutions with supplementary advantages. Overall, the project benefited by
        knowing the stakeholders' viewpoints and how human practices affected the project. It helped the project
        represent its objectives in the most effective way possible. The need to interact with project stakeholders was
        crucial to us. We benefitted immensely from considering the potential effects our initiative may have on them
        and learning about their viewpoints on the matter. The stakeholders we identified are all mentioned here, along
        with an explanation of why we contacted them and what we discovered.</p>

      *insert stakeholder division graphic*

      <h2>Outreach</h2>
      <p>For our integrated human practices and outreach, reaching out to fish farmers was crucial. We gathered
        information on prevalence, current solutions, and the viability of AMPifin through these visits. The visits
        covered numerous locations, both national and international.</p>

      <h2>Academia</h2>
      <p>We sought input from professors working in the field on various techniques, including the viability of our
        models. Whether it came to our literature surveys or our experimental design, their overall perspectives on our
        project as subject-matter experts was extremely valuable. Furthermore, to find out the professional-scale
        research being conducted on our project’s topics that were relevant to our project, we contacted members from
        research institutes.</p>

      <h2>Companies</h2>
      <p>We contacted companies in the fields of biotechnology-based companies, synthetic biology-based companies,
        aquaculture-based companies, and experts in the research and development fields of various companies. Their
        input shaped our solution’s commercial viability.</p>

      <h2>Entrepreneurs</h2>
      <p>To improve our study of novel approaches such as ours, we wanted to connect with experts in entrepreneurship.
        They helped us understand how we can work on the future upscaling of our project and the band of stakeholders
        that would be important to us.</p>

      <h2>Doctors</h2>
      <p>Vibriosis is a disease that affects humans and fish, and to understand its impact in both cases, we consulted
        doctors who helped us analyse the impact and medical solutions. Through these interactions, we learnt the
        symptoms and treatment methods of vibriosis in humans. Additionally, we gained more information on the
        pathogenicity and virulence of <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i>.</p>
      <h2>Our values</h2>
      *insert R’s graphic*
      <h3>Responsible</h3>
      <p>As iGEM is a competition based on synthetic biology, there are several biosafety issues that could emerge. Our
        target organism — <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> is a risk-2 organism. In order to avoid any sort of hazard that
        could possibly exist, we decided to not work with this organism for our experiments. Instead, we decided to
        express our target molecule – MAM7 in our <i>E.coli</i>.
      <p>
      <h3>Reflective</h3>
      <p>Our IHP and community engagement formed the backbone of our project. The conversations we had with the multiple
        individuals helped us gain a holistic perspective of the problem. The insights and opinions helped us shape our
        project. After every interaction, our team would sit together and reflect upon the content of the meetings in
        order to make improvements to our solution to make it more sustainable.</p>
      <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
      <p>Following our session on reflection on the IHP meetings or community engagement programs, we implement their
        opinions into our project to the best of our ability. Since this project was created in order to help out the
        local people and the problems they face, incorporating their opinions and needs into our project was crucial.
        Our project trajectory changed majorly due to their inputs. Public opinion is a key aspect for development of
        any product, and thereby it has contributed majorly for the amalgamation of our project.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>“Local people solving local problems” is a phrase that describes AMPifin accurately. Following a value-centric
        approach, we noticed that Manipal being a coastal town is home to a massive aquaculture industry setup. As our
        conversations with various stakeholders and communities developed, we came across Mr. Kaushik Alike, who
        introduced us to <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> and the diseases it causes. This bacteria piqued our curiosity,
        and through this interaction, we fixated on our problem statement and decided to build on it systematically.
      </p>

      <p>The food-chain supply for seafood consists of hatcheries, farms, markets, restaurants, and finally, consumers.
        To understand the impact of vibriosis, we interacted with various stakeholders from in and around India in
        Maharashtra, Karnataka, Hyderabad, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and internationally in Dubai. These interactions
        helped augment our project and accelerated its growth and research.</p>

      <h2>Interaction with Canares Aquaculture LPP</h2>

      <p>On 21st November, 2022, we contacted Kaushik Alike, one of the founders of Canares Aquaculture. He spoke to us
        about various topics, including parasites and viruses, as well as feed and water purification. We learnt about
        the major diseases in fish and the present methods of prevention and cure. He was the one who first mentioned
        <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> and Oxytetracycline to us. We decided to work on the bacteria <i>Vibrio
          parahaemolyticus</i> owing to the insightful conversation we had with him and the information he provided to
        us.
      </p>
      <p>An aspect he emphasised on, was the significance of not entirely eradicating all microorganisms from the water
        body. He also discussed several strategies for distributing feed and raising fish.</p>

      <h2>Government Shrimp and Fish Hatchery</h2>

      <p>Government institutions have the most information about all aspects of science and its various regulatory
        aspects. For this reason, we decided to approach a government hatchery to get more information about this
        disease.</p>

      <p>On 1st July 2022, we visited a Government Shrimp and Fish Hatchery in Azhikode, Kerala, India . We interacted
        with their association members—Assistant Fisheries Extension Officers—Mrs. Merit Kurian, Mrs. Devi Chandran, and
        Mr. Vinu Jacob. The primary focus of this institution is to hatch shrimp and fish for 20–25 days using biofloc
        technology and then sell them to various fish farmers. </p>

      <p>They mentioned that the main types of fish that are hatched are Etroplus and Pompano. They elaborated on the
        primary local diseases observed in their farm. It astounded us to hear that there are multiple species
        responsible for various levels and types of pathogenicity. The fisherfolk mostly look for cuts or bruises found
        on the scales and the fish's skin for early detection of any diseases. To avoid necrosis, a significant symptom
        of vibriosis, pretreatment methods are employed immediately after the seeds are hatched. In the case of an
        infection, antibiotics are used as a treatment method. They emphasised on how the dosage has seen a surge over
        the years. Furthermore, they mentioned that detection is primarily carried out via PCR. Their hatchery consists
        of massive units, maintained at a temperature varying from 25-28\( \degree C \) using regulated heaters, and the
        salinity of
        the water is maintained at 20 ppm. Through this visit, we learnt about the various methods to identify the
        levels of pathogenicity and the manner in which fisherfolk differentiate between a diseased and healthy fish. We
        also learned more about methods by which they prevent or cure bacterial infections in fish.</p>

      <p>When we explained AMPifin to them, they were interested in our solution's approach. In particular, they were
        impressed with our focus on sustainability. In particular, they were keen on exploring a solution that has no
        known side effects and is unlikely to induce antibiotic resistance. Through this visit, we comprehended the
        large-scale working of fish hatcheries and developed an understanding of how AMPifin can be stitched toward
        being a more operational solution. The data we received from them was valuable and helped improve the
        interpretation of our literature surveys. Furthermore, we gained confidence in our sustainable approach and
        focused on making AMPifin more understandable to our main stakeholders.</p>

      <h2>Laxmipuri Fish Market</h2>

      <p>Fish markets are the hub for fish trade and team AMPifin decided to interact with them to understand the
        food-supply chain and their methods of identification for diseased fish. Furthermore, the platform served as a
        location to interact with consumers, too.</p>

      <p>On 6th July 2022, we visited Laxmipuri Fish Market located in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India. It is owned by Mr.
        Ashish, Mr. Kiran, and Mr. Ashok—fish sellers and consumers from a local fish market. They mentioned that their
        fish market receives over a hundred varieties of fish from the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. The fish
        supply is stored and sold for two to three days until freshness is retained. Furthermore, in case any spoilage
        is detected, they discard it immediately in a safe manner. As we conversed with them, we realised that the
        methods of prevention of diseases in most seafood shops were nebulous, especially for the wild-caught ones.
        Since most of them were sellers and not pisciculture farmers, they did not have much knowledge about the various
        medicines used in fish hatcheries. We explained our project to them and they provided us with their opinion on
        selling or consuming seafood that has been treated with our peptide. Since our solution is a natural peptide,
        they were extremely welcoming of it. Furthermore, they were very encouraging of more such sustainable solutions.
        From this visit, we understood the importance of consulting secondary stakeholders, who are a critical part of
        the food supply chain.</p>

      <h2>Visit to Shrimp and Fish farm</h2>

      <p>On the 8th of July, we visited Mr. Sampath's shrimp and fish farm in Chennai, India. While showing us around
        his farm, he elaborated on the two main species of shrimps grown—giant Tiger prawns (<i>Penaeus monodon</i>) and
        Whiteleg shrimps (<i> Litopenaeus vannamei</i>). The salinity range maintained in his farm roughly accounts for
        about 25%, along with a pH range of 8.5, and the breeding period is usually carried out for four months. He
        mentioned how these conditions were applicable for fish as well.</p>

      <p>For fish, any disease is detected by visual cues—like cuts, scars, bleeding on the skin, scientifically termed
        as “necrosis”. The detection of such diseases is carried out by testing the water with a calcium soda mix. Since
        AMPifin could potentially be a broad-spectrum solution for all gram-negative pathogens, we were delighted to see
        such accepting nature for the utilisation of our product AMPifin.</p>

      <h2>ICAR-CIBA Institute, Chennai, India</h2>

      <p>On 8th July 2022, we visited the Indian Council of Agricultural Research—Central Institute of Brackishwater
        Research (ICAR-CIBA) located in Chennai. We met with Dr. M Shashi Shekar and his team consisting of Dr. Ashok,
        Dr. Raymond, Dr. Sujeet and Dr. Patil who are currently working on vibriosis in fish. We felt that the
        information they had would benefit our project’s geographical statistics and research-related data. There was a
        brief discussion about the types of projects they were working on for the research-oriented communities and
        looking for potential areas in which they could be of great help to us. Dr. Shekar introduced us to his lab and
        team. The exchange of scientific data and information turned out to be very fruitful for our project. We gained
        more of the practicality of fish cultivating industries that their years of research withheld.</p>

      <h2>Al Fahlain Aquaculture and Agricultural LLC</h2>

      <p>We visited The Al Fahlain fish farm in Dubai, UAE, headed by Mr. Liju, to check the prevalence of vibriosis
        in locations outside of India. Initially, he exchanged data about the food they usually feed the fish, which
        were mostly floating pellets that they import from Saudi and sinking pellets which are rich sources of protein
        imported from Turkey. </p>

      <p>They indicated that vibriosis is a common disease in fish in that area, but due to restricted lab facilities,
        it is not usually tested and hence, goes undetected.</p>

      <p>From our visit, we observed that they use antibiotics to treat these infected fish and the most commonly used
        one is Oxytetracycline (OTC). OTC is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and is hence helpful in most common diseases.
        Erythromycin was used previously along with OTC but isn’t effective for many diseases anymore, and hence it
        has been banned in many countries, including India and Dubai. In the cases where they cannot detect the
        disease in the fish and find ways to treat it, they usually flush the column with salt water if freshwater
        fish are being grown and vice versa. They spend approximately 1% of their income treating these
        fish(approximately 500 AED—i.e., 136 USD). To reduce the number of infected fish imported, they usually run a
        PCR test from India or whichever country it is imported from. This has reduced the mortality rate of fish to
        20%. </p>

      <p>Apart from these diseases in fish, the main cause of diseases in this fish farm was the high-density
        culturing of fish, due to which the oxygen level and space for each fish reduces. They have external liquid
        oxygen that is usually pumped into the fish columns depending on the need and necessity. </p>

      <p>This visit helped us analyse the prevalence of vibriosis outside of India as well. Furthermore, we
        distributed large-size pamphlets on the safe usage of antibiotics, and explained AMPifin to the fish farm
        owners. </p>

      <h2>Aquatic Biosystems</h2>
      Initially, vibriosis started out as a local problem team AMPifin wanted to focus on. To gain a closer look into
      the problem around the Mangalore-Manipal region, we visited Aquatic Biosystems.</p>

      <p>We visited Aquatic Biosystems in Mangalore, owned by Mr. Ronald D’Souza. He set up Aquatic Biosystems in
        2006, which is currently the largest ornamental fish farm in the state. He began by talking to us about the
        history and origin of his biosystem. As he showed us around his fish farm he spoke about the major diseases
        they face. He mentioned that viral and bacterial infections are quite common. If there are any symptoms of
        bacterial infections, they isolate the fish and send a sample to the lab at the Fisheries Institute,
        Mangalore. The common bacterial species they have to deal with are <i>Aeromonas</i> species, <i>Vibrio</i>
        species and <i>Pseudomonas</i> species. The common treatment methods for these are Oxytetracycline (OTC) and
        Enrofloxacin (ENR). Of these, OTC works better than ENR. However, if OTC does not work, they use Seromycin
        followed by lab testing.</p>

      <p>Every year, they face a loss percentage of 5–10% due to different types of diseases. On explaining our
        project to him, he was eager to see the result. He explained how the pipe fittings and the connections were
        formed in order to incorporate various water filters. This paved the route for our delivery mechanism to find
        an appropriate real-life application. Given the description of the RAS in his farm, we made our implementation
        design in order to increase the feasibility for our poor fish farmers to integrate AMPifin in their farms. He
        showed sheer eagerness in our project and also said that solutions like AMPifin are required in our society as
        antibiotic resistance is a rising concern.</p>

      <h2>Thimmapa Restaurant</h2>

      <p>To understand the impact of vibriosis on our secondary stakeholders—i.e., seafood restaurant chefs and
        owners, we decided to visit a renowned restaurant in the Udupi region of Karnataka. We wanted to observe the
        various procurement, cleaning, sanitisation, and cooking practices carried out by the hotel administrators.
        Furthermore, we wanted to understand the impact and significance of our solution at this stage of the food
        supply chain.</p>

      <p>On October 3rd, 2022, a few of our team members visited Hotel Thimappa—a seafood restaurant in Udupi,
        Karnataka. We spoke with the owner about how the fish is stored and prepared at their restaurant. He explained
        that the monsoon season around July to October is the best time of the year for fishing. For the past 40
        years, the restaurant has purchased its fish from the same vendor located in and around the coast of Malpe.
        When we enquired if they receive diseased or rotten fish from the vendors, they replied that most of the time
        they sort out all the fish right after they are caught, so that the disease spread is contained. However,
        during the months of May and June, they may have more probability of receiving rotten fish as they are less
        available at this time and they are refrigerated for longer than usual. To get more insight on the issues that
        the restaurants face with diseased fish, we enquired about the different ways by which they recognise diseased
        fish. The chefs told us that if it’s a rotten fish, it can be distinguished while cleaning due to the
        difference in texture and smell. However, if it is a diseased fish, it is hard to detect while cleaning. These
        fish are identified during the cooking stage.</p>

      <p>We introduced them to our project—AMPifin and they were inquisitive about our delivery mechanism. From this
        visit, we understood the effects of diseased/rotten fish on different stages of consumption. We also learned
        the methods of segregating rotten or diseased fish at a seafood restaurant so that we do not get sick. We
        ended this visit by trying two of their famous seafood dishes. The dishes were absolutely delicious which
        highlighted how these cuisines form the backbone of our rich Indian culture. This visit helped us broaden our
        stakeholder interaction spectrum and understand the prevalence of vibriosis at various stages of the
        food-supply chain.</p>

      <h2>Podcast along with The Astronomy Club, Manipal.</h2>
      <p>On 7th October, 2022, we collaborated with the Astronomy Club, Manipal to talk about synthetic biology and
        its applications in the space industry. The podcast comprised two members of the Astronomy Club and two
        members of Manipal BioMachines. The podcast started off with an introduction to the respective members and
        iGEM. The discussion was based on how syn-bio could be used to enhance and use the extreme environments of
        space to our advantage. For example—extremophiles for the elimination of biowaste and synthesis of
        biomaterial, self healing bio-compounds for integrity of the space shuttle, nutrient-rich-space-conserving
        food, etc given the limitation on resources that can be carried. There were talks about previous iGEM teams’
        projects that built on the motive of improving space travel quality for the travellers by integrating pure
        synthetic biology based components. </p>

      <p>This podcast was an opportunity for us to collaborate with astrophiles and understand their areas of
        interest. By engaging with the astrophile community, we were able to spread the idea of synthetic biology to
        various groups. Astrobiology is a vast field and has developed for itself avid learners. Through this podcast,
        our aim was to introduce them to a novel field under the same branch of science. Refer to our collaboration
        section to listen to the podcast l=l</p>

      <h2>Consumer Survey</h2>

      <p>To understand the perception of the general public on the pisciculture industry, we rolled out an exhaustive
        consumer survey. This survey helped us understand the opinion of the general public on sustainable solutions
