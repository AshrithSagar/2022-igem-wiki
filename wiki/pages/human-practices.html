      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll"><b>Vibriosis</b> is a serious disease in fish, crustaceans and shellfish as recognised
        by the FAO, United
        Nations. It
        leads to <b>significant economic losses</b> and affects multiple sectors, thus hindering the development of
        the
        country. According to a recent study, the most prevalent species triggering vibriosis in aquaculture farms are
        <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio owensii, and Vibrio campbelli</i>.
        The
        pathogenicity of these species is aided by a wide range of virulence factors, which allows them to infect a
        wide range of hosts [1].
      </p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">Our aim through AMPifin is to <b>improve pisciculture operations</b>, and consequently
        increase the yield of
        fish in
        the market—a major part of various Indian states’ staple diets. This approach would immensely benefit the
        economy and fisherfolk by facilitating a sustainable pisciculture industry. AMPifin is a <b>sustainable</b>
        solution to
        vibriosis in fish. In line with our project’s work, we carried out extensive work concerning human practices.
      </p>
      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Problems</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">The idea for the project provided us with a plethora of possibilities. Still, our
        literature research and
        responsibility toward the marine populations reiterated our sense of commitment to prioritise a sustainable
        approach through our solution. Nevertheless, we encountered numerous challenges during our ideation, research,
        and experimentation process. We considered how our team could cushion the pisciculture industry. We knew that
        for our initiative to be successful, we needed to combine and maximise the best aspects of our <b>core values,
          scientific reasoning, and community involvement</b>.</p>
      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Solutions</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">During the initial stages of our project, we talked to a fish farm owner who
        introduced us to the disease
        Vibriosis. We discovered that <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> is the causative bacteria. Our project’s work
        began
        by interacting with an expert in the field of computational biology who guided us on the engineering and
        designing aspects of our peptide. Through continuous interactions, we received the idea of <b>mimicking
          fibronectin</b>. As we progressed, we met with some experts who stressed the imperativeness of
        <b>biosafety</b> aspects and
        guided us toward a safe delivery mechanism—i.e., implementing <b>chitosan nanoparticle encapsulation</b>
        instead
        of
        bacterial encapsulation. Moreover, they drew our attention to the possible side effects of biomagnification;
        hence, we ran a <b>toxicity and allergen test on our peptide</b>. As AMPifin came together, we interacted with
        numerous
        stakeholders and introduced them to our solution. Through our correspondence, we established a connection with
        an <b>all-inclusive demographic</b>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Stakeholder approach</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">We received numerous comments and ideas after holding several meetings and
        conversations with <b>specialists,
          researchers, professors, and farmers</b>. These conversations provided valuable feedback that improved the
        areas we
        overlooked in our project and recommended strategies to speed up its development. Without these interactions,
        AMPifin would be considerably different. To better our approach at each stage, we engaged in a fruitful
        dialogue
        with various stakeholders. We conversed with multiple industry specialists, academia, the general public,
        students, and our project's target consumer—the fisherfolk. This paved the way for our project's advancement,
        and helped us reflect on AMPifin's objectives effectively. It enabled us to identify the many issues or flaws
        in
        our project and identify better solutions with supplementary advantages. Overall, the project benefited by
        knowing the stakeholders' viewpoints and how human practices affected the project. It helped the project
        represent its objectives in the most effective way possible. The need to interact with project stakeholders
        was
        crucial to us. We benefitted immensely from considering our initiative's potential effects on them and
        learning
        about their viewpoints on the matter. The stakeholders we identified are all mentioned here, along
        with an explanation of why we contacted them and what we discovered.</p>

      <h3 class="reveal-on-scroll">Outreach</h3>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">For our integrated human practices and outreach, reaching out to the fisherfolk was
        crucial. We gathered
        information on prevalence, current solutions, and the viability of AMPifin through these visits. The visits
        covered numerous locations, both national and international.</p>

      <h3 class="reveal-on-scroll">Academia</h3>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">We sought input from professors working in the field on various techniques, including
        the viability of our
        models. Whether it came to our literature surveys or our experimental design, their overall perspectives on
        our
        project as subject-matter experts was extremely valuable. Furthermore, to find out the professional-scale
        research being conducted on our project’s topics that were relevant to our project, we contacted members from
        research institutes.</p>

      <h3 class="reveal-on-scroll">Companies</h3>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">We contacted companies in the fields of biotechnology, synthetic biology, and
        aquaculture. Their
        input shaped our solution’s commercial viability.</p>

      <h3 class="reveal-on-scroll">Entrepreneurs</h3>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">To improve our study of novel approaches such as ours, we wanted to connect with
        experts in entrepreneurship.
        They helped us understand how we can work on the future upscaling of our project and the band of stakeholders
        that would be important to us.</p>

      <h3 class="reveal-on-scroll">Doctors</h3>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">Vibriosis is a disease that affects humans and fish, and to understand its impact in
        both cases, we consulted
        doctors who helped us analyse the impact and medical solutions. Through these interactions, we learnt the
        symptoms and treatment methods of vibriosis in humans. Additionally, we gained more information on the
        pathogenicity and virulence of <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i>.</p>

      <h3 class="reveal-on-scroll">Responsible</h3>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">As iGEM is a competition based on synthetic biology, there are several biosafety
        issues that could emerge.
        Our
        target organism—<i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> is a Risk Group 2 organism. To avoid any sort of hazards, we
        decided to not work with this organism for our experiments. Instead, we decided to
        express our target molecule–MAM7 via <i>E.coli</i>.
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">
      <h3 class="reveal-on-scroll">Reflective</h3>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">Human practices and community engagement formed the backbone of our project. The
        conversations we had with
        the
        multiple
        individuals helped us gain a holistic perspective of the problem. The insights and opinions helped us shape
        our
        project. After every interaction, our team sat together and reflected upon the content of the meetings in
        order to make improvements to our solution.</p>
      <h3 class="reveal-on-scroll">Responsiveness</h3>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">Following our session on reflection on the community engagement programmes, we
        implemented their
        opinion to the best of our ability. Since this project was created to help out the
        local people and the problems they face, incorporating their opinions and needs into our project was crucial.
        Our project trajectory changed majorly due to their input. Public opinion is a key aspect for development of
        any product, and thereby it has contributed majorly for the amalgamation of our project.</p>

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Overview</h2>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">“Local people solving local problems” is a phrase that describes AMPifin accurately.
        Following a
        value-centric
        approach, we noticed that Manipal being a coastal town is home to a massive aquaculture industry setup. As our
        conversations with various stakeholders and communities developed, we came across <b>Mr. Kaushik Alike</b>,
        who
        introduced us to <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> and the diseases it causes. This bacteria piqued our
        curiosity,
        and through this interaction, we fixated on our problem statement and decided to build on it systematically.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">The food-chain supply for seafood consists of hatcheries, farms, markets, restaurants,
        and finally,
        consumers.
        To understand the impact of vibriosis, we interacted with various stakeholders from in and around India in
        Maharashtra, Karnataka, Hyderabad, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and internationally, in Dubai. These interactions
        helped augment our project and accelerated its growth.</p>

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Interaction with Canares Aquaculture LPP</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">On 21st November 2022, we contacted Kaushik Alike, one of the founders of Canares
        Aquaculture. He spoke to us
        about various topics, including parasites and viruses, as well as feed and water purification. We learnt about
        the major diseases in fish and the present methods of prevention and cure. He was the one who first mentioned
        <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> and Oxytetracycline to us. We decided to work on the bacteria <i>Vibrio
          parahaemolyticus</i> owing to the insightful conversation we had with him.An aspect he emphasised was the
        significance of not entirely eradicating all microorganisms from the water
        body. He also discussed several strategies for distributing feed and raising fish.
      </p>

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Government Shrimp and Fish Hatchery</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">To gain more knowledge of areas outside of our locality, we decided to approach a
        government hatchery to get
        more information about the prevalence of vibriosis.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">On 1st July 2022, we visited a Government Shrimp and Fish Hatchery in Azhikode,
        Kerala, India . We interacted
        with their association members—Assistant Fisheries Extension Officers—Mrs. Merit Kurian, Mrs. Devi Chandran,
        and
        Mr. Vinu Jacob. The primary focus of this institution is to hatch shrimp and fish for 20–25 days using biofloc
        technology and then sell them to various fish farmers.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">They mentioned that the main types of fish that are hatched are Etroplus and Pompano.
        They elaborated on the
        primary local diseases observed in their farm. It astounded us to hear that there are multiple species
        responsible for various levels and types of pathogenicity. The fisherfolk mostly look for cuts or bruises
        found
        on the scales and the fish's skin for early detection of any diseases. To avoid necrosis, a significant
        symptom
        of vibriosis, pretreatment methods are employed immediately after the seeds are hatched. In the case of an
        infection, antibiotics are used as a treatment method. They emphasised on how the dosage has seen a surge over
        the years. Furthermore, they mentioned that detection is primarily carried out via PCR. Their hatchery
        consists
        of massive units, maintained at a temperature varying from 25-28 degrees celcius using regulated heaters, and
        the
        salinity of
        the water is maintained at 20 ppm. Through this visit, we learnt about the various methods to identify the
        levels of pathogenicity and how fisherfolk differentiate between diseased and healthy fish. We
        also learned more about methods by which they prevent or cure bacterial infections in fish.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">When we explained AMPifin to them, they were interested in our solution's approach. In
        particular, they were
        impressed with our focus on sustainability. In particular, they were keen on exploring a solution that has no
        known side effects and is unlikely to induce antibiotic resistance. Through this visit, we comprehended the
        large-scale working of fish hatcheries and developed an understanding of how AMPifin can be stitched toward
        being a more operational solution. The data we received from them was valuable and helped improve the
        interpretation of our literature surveys. Furthermore, we gained confidence in our sustainable approach and
        focused on making AMPifin more understandable to our main stakeholders.</p>

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Laxmipuri Fish Market</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">Fish markets are the hub for fish trade and team AMPifin decided to interact with them
        to understand the
        food-supply chain and their methods of identification for diseased fish. Furthermore, the platform served as a
        location to interact with consumers, too.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">On 6th July 2022, we visited Laxmipuri Fish Market located in Kolhapur, Maharashtra,
        India. It is owned by
        Mr.
        Ashish, Mr. Kiran, and Mr. Ashok—fish sellers and consumers from a local fish market. They mentioned that
        their
        fish market receives over a hundred varieties of fish from the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. The fish
        supply is stored and sold for two to three days until freshness is retained. Furthermore, in case any spoilage
        is detected, they discard the fish immediately in a safe manner. As we conversed with them, we realised that
        the
        methods of prevention of diseases in most seafood shops were nebulous, especially for the wild-caught ones.
        Since most of them were sellers and not pisciculture farmers, they did not have much knowledge on the various
        medicines used in fish hatcheries. We explained our project to them and they provided us with their opinion on
        selling or consuming seafood that has been treated with our peptide. Since most were sellers and not
        pisciculture farmers, they did not know much about the various medicines used in fish hatcheries. Furthermore,
        they were encouraging of more such sustainable solutions. From this visit, we understood the importance of
        consulting secondary stakeholders, who are a critical part of the food supply chain.</p>

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Visit to Shrimp and Fish Farm</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">On 8th July 2022, we visited Mr. Sampath's shrimp and fish farm in Chennai, India.
        While showing us around
        his farm, he elaborated on the two main species of shrimps grown—giant Tiger prawns (<i>Penaeus monodon</i>)
        and
        Whiteleg shrimps (<i> Litopenaeus vannamei</i>). The salinity range maintained in his farm roughly accounts
        for
        about 25%, along with a pH range of 8.5, and the breeding period is usually carried out for four months. He
        mentioned how these conditions were applicable for fish as well.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">For fish, any disease is detected by visual cues—cuts, scars, bleeding on the skin,
        and necrosis. The
        detection
        of such diseases is carried out by testing the water with a calcium soda mix. Since
        AMPifin could potentially be a broad-spectrum solution for all gram-negative pathogens, we were delighted to
        see
        such accepting nature toward the utilisation of our solution.</p>

        Institute of Brackishwater
        Research (ICAR-CIBA) located in Chennai. We met with Dr. M Shashi Shekar and his team consisting of Dr. Ashok,
        Dr. Raymond, Dr. Sujeet and Dr. Patil who are currently working on vibriosis in fish. We felt that the
        information they had would benefit our project’s geographical statistics and research-related data. There was
        a
        brief discussion about the types of projects they were working on for the research-oriented communities and
        looking for potential areas in which they could be of great help to us. Dr. Shekar introduced us to his lab

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Al Fahlain Aquaculture and Agricultural LLC</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">We visited The Al Fahlain fish farm in Dubai, UAE, headed by Mr. Liju, to check the
        prevalence of vibriosis
        in locations outside of India. Initially, he exchanged data about the food they usually feed the fish, which
        were mostly floating pellets that they import from Saudi Arabia and sinking pellets which are rich sources of
        protein
        imported from Turkey. </p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">They indicated that vibriosis is a common disease in fish in that area, but due to
        restricted lab facilities,
        it is not usually tested.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">From our visit, we observed that they use antibiotics to treat these infected fish and
        the most commonly used
        one is Oxytetracycline (OTC). OTC is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and is hence helpful in most common diseases.
        Erythromycin was used previously along with OTC but isn’t effective for many diseases anymore, and hence, it
        has been banned in many countries, including India and Dubai. In cases where they cannot detect the
        disease in the fish, they usually flush the column with salt water if freshwater
        fish are being grown and vice versa. They spend approximately 1% of their income treating these
        fish (approximately 500 AED—i.e., 136 USD). To reduce the number of infected fish imported, they usually run a
        PCR test from the country of import. This has reduced the mortality rate of fish by
        20%. </p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">Apart from these diseases in fish, the main cause of diseases in this fish farm was
        the high-density
        culturing of fish, due to which the oxygen level and space for each fish reduces. They have external liquid
        oxygen that is usually pumped into the fish columns depending on the need and necessity. </p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">This visit helped us analyse the prevalence of vibriosis outside of India as well.
        Furthermore, we
        distributed large-size pamphlets on the safe usage of antibiotics, and explained AMPifin to the fish farm
        owners. </p>

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Aquatic Biosystems</h2>
      Initially, vibriosis started out as a local problem team AMPifin wanted to focus on. To gain a closer look into
      the problem around the Mangalore-Manipal region, we visited Aquatic Biosystems.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">We visited Aquatic Biosystems in Mangalore, owned by Mr. Ronald D’Souza. He set up
        Aquatic Biosystems in
        2006, which is currently the largest ornamental fish farm in the state. He began by talking to us about the
        history and origin of his biosystem. As he showed us around his fish farm he spoke about the major diseases
        they face. He mentioned that viral and bacterial infections are quite common. If there are any symptoms of
        bacterial infections, they isolate the fish and send a sample to the lab at the Fisheries Institute,
        Mangalore. The common bacterial species they have to deal with are <i>Aeromonas</i> species, <i>Vibrio</i>
        species and <i>Pseudomonas</i> species. The common treatment methods for these are Oxytetracycline (OTC) and
        Enrofloxacin (ENR). Of these, OTC works better than ENR. However, if OTC does not work, they use Seromycin
        followed by lab testing.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">Every year, they face a loss percentage of 5–10% due to different types of diseases.
        On explaining our
        project to him, he was eager to see the result. He explained how the pipe fittings and the connections were
        formed in order to incorporate various water filters. This paved the route for our delivery mechanism to find
        an appropriate real-life application. Given the description of the Recirculatory Aquaculture System (RAS) in
        his
        farm, we made our implementation
        design to increase the feasibility of integrating AMPifin in fish farms. He
        displayed eagerness toward our project and said that solutions like AMPifin are required owing to
        antibiotic resistance becoming a rising concern.</p>

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Thimmapa Restaurant</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">To understand the impact of vibriosis on our secondary stakeholders—i.e., seafood
        restaurant chefs and
        owners, we decided to visit a renowned restaurant in the Udupi region of Karnataka. We wanted to observe the
        various procurement, cleaning, sanitisation, and cooking practices carried out by the hotel administrators.
        Furthermore, we wanted to understand the impact and significance of our solution at this stage of the food
        supply chain.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">On October 3rd 2022, a few of our team members visited Hotel Thimappa—a seafood
        restaurant in Udupi,
        Karnataka. We spoke with the owner about how the fish is stored and prepared at their restaurant. He explained
        that the monsoon season around July to October is the best time of the year for fishing. For the past 40
        years, the restaurant has purchased its fish from the same vendor located in and around the coast of Malpe.
        When we enquired if they receive diseased or rotten fish from the vendors, they replied that most of the time
        they sort out all the fish right after they are caught, so that the disease spread is contained. However,
        during the months of May and June, they may have more probability of receiving rotten fish as they are less
        available at this time and refrigerated for longer durations. To gain more insight on the issues that
        restaurants face with diseased fish, we enquired about the different ways by which they recognise diseased
        fish. The chefs told us that if it is a rotten fish, it can be distinguished while cleaning due to the
        difference in texture and smell. However, if it is a diseased fish, it is hard to detect while cleaning. These
        fish are identified during the cooking stage.</p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">We introduced them to our project—AMPifin and they were inquisitive about our delivery
        mechanism. From this
        visit, we understood the effects of diseased/rotten fish on different stages of consumption. We also learned
        the methods of segregating rotten or diseased fish at a seafood restaurant. We
        ended this visit by trying two of their famous seafood dishes. The dishes were absolutely delicious, and
        highlighted how these cuisines form the backbone of our rich Indian culture. This visit helped us broaden our
        stakeholder interaction spectrum and understand the prevalence of vibriosis at various stages of the
        food-supply chain.</p>

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Podcast with The Astronomy Club, Manipal.</h2>
      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">On 7th October 2022, we collaborated with the Astronomy Club, Manipal to talk about
        synthetic biology and
        its applications in the space industry. The podcast comprised two members of the Astronomy Club and two
        members of Manipal BioMachines. The podcast started off with an introduction to the respective members and
        iGEM. The discussion was based on how synthetic biology could be used to enhance and use the extreme
        environments of
        space to our advantage. For example—extremophiles for the elimination of biowaste and synthesis of
        biomaterial, self healing bio-compounds for integrity of the space shuttle, and nutrient-rich-space-conserving
        food given the limitation on resources that can be carried. There were talks about previous iGEM teams’
        projects that built on the motive of improving space travel quality for the travellers by integrating pure
        synthetic biology based components. </p>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">This podcast was an opportunity for us to collaborate with astrophiles and understand
        their areas of
        interest. By engaging with the astrophile community, we were able to spread the idea of synthetic biology to
        various groups. Astrobiology is a vast field and has developed for itself avid learners. Through this podcast,
        our aim was to introduce them to a novel field under the same branch of science. Refer to our <a

      <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Consumer Survey</h2>

      <p class="reveal-on-scroll">To understand the perception of the general public on the pisciculture industry, we
        rolled out an exhaustive
        consumer survey. This survey helped us understand the opinion of the general public on sustainable solutions
        based on synthetic biology. The responses brought a broader perspective to our project, and it was interesting
        to see the level of awareness amongst various seafood consumers on diseases in fish and their prevalence.

        <h2 class="reveal-on-scroll">Overview</h2>
        <p class="reveal-on-scroll">Fish is a source of high protein, vitamins and nutrients for humans. With the
          population surge, the
          requirement
          for nutrition has skyrocketed. The aquaculture sector plays an important role in the breeding of fish.
          India,
          being a peninsula, is a major contributor of this sector.</p>

        <p class="reveal-on-scroll">The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying,
          are implementing a
          flagship
          scheme <b>“Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)”</b>—A scheme to bring about Blue Revolution through
          sustainable and responsible development of the fisheries sector in India. This scheme has seen the
          highest-ever
          investment of approximately INR 20,050 crore (approximately USD 2,434,226,390) for five years, with effect
          from the financial year 2020–21 to
          2024–25 in all states/union territories [1]. Despite these initiatives, India presently accounts for about
          7.56%
          of the global production of fish [2].</p>

        <p class="reveal-on-scroll">Since Udupi is a coastal town, this district contributes considerably to the
          production of fish in India.
          As
          a
          group of undergraduate students, our insight into this world and people's problems are limited. Therefore to
          promote the iGEM values of “local people solving local problems,” we began with our journey to understand
          the
          problem and find its root cause.</p>

        <p class="reveal-on-scroll">We received our problem statement through a telephone meeting with Mr. Kaushik
          Alike, the owner of Canares
          Aquaculture LPP. Our interest in this topic grew as we spoke to many more experts, scholars, fish farmers,
          etc.,
          after which we chose our target bacteria <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>. Their
          inputs steered us towards formulating the most appropriate solution that would be sustainable in the long
          run.
          Our human practices efforts have been the backbone of our project since the beginning. Through our
          timeline, we have represented our interactions and their magnanimous impact toward AMPifin.

                  finding a template to use for our protein study. Initially, he recommended we use BLAST for the
                  available information in databases, and find homologous protein structures. Based on his
                  suggestions, we built a homology model, and utilised Alphafold for structure prediction.
                  Furthermore, he suggested exploring the available peptide libraries to comprehend the protein and
                  the interaction between MAM7 and Fibronectin. Finally, he asked us to make sure that the
                  hypothesis
                  we produce is functional by carrying out a trial run.

                  could find an average sequence by using Alphafold for MAM7 and then utilising it to generate the
                  fibronectin structure. Based on that, we decided to run the molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) of

                  adhesion and thus prevent the infection itself. During the discussion on vibriosis, he indicated

                  cultivation practices of fish. He told us that vibriosis is quite prevalent in fish breeds such as
                  Mullet and Milkfish. Being well-versed with
                  the different diagnostic methods used for various ecosystems such as freshwater, saline, marine,
                  brackish water, etc., he mentioned the commonly utilised medicines or antibiotics, which are fed
                  to
                  the fish in the system. According to his experience, vibriosis is prevalent due to the changes in
                  various environmental factors, weather, climatic change, and the water’s pH and contaminant
                  levels,
                  collectively termed as “stress-factors”. He concluded that the effect of vibriosis in humans is
                  dependent on each individual’s immune system and how their body reacts to it. Furthermore, he
                  elaborated on the various early detection methods such as PCR, western blotting, kit-based
                  methods,
                  and microscopic analysis.</p>

                  <h5>OUR INFERENCE</h5>
                  This interaction shed light on the feeding mechanisms practised in the fish farms. The nutritional
                  value of the fish can only be maintained by providing a balanced supply of the diet. Furthermore,
                  in
                  order to incorporate our project as a practical approach, our formula will vary for various fish
                  species with
                  different intake capacities. His input pushed us to study the current methods used for on-field
                  fish
                  testing. We found out that diseased fish are usually isolated in the fish ponds or taken to the
                  labs for further testing in an artificial ecosystem. He mentioned that the usual practice of the
                  local fish farmers is to subject the fishes to various antibiotics, chemicals, such as KMnO4,
                  NaCl,
                  and soda lime, etc to get rid of the disease in the farm. This helped us brainstorm ideas to
                  spread
                  awareness on the safe usage of antibiotics.

                  our
                  project idea and its potential impact on the pisciculture industry. Based on the stability of our
                  peptide when released into a pisciculture system, she highlighted the possibilities of our peptide
                  undergoing degradation and high dilution. She spoke about lab-scale testing of our peptide for
                  interaction studies. To overcome such challenges, she suggested we look into methods like
                  encapsulation and check the integrity properties in accordance with the release of the peptide
                  into
                  the aquaculture set-up. She also told us to look into our solution's economic viability, upscaling
                  its production and food safety factors. Additionally, she conveyed her concerns regarding the
                  peptide purification
                  aspects of our project. She recommended we use the HPLC system for regular purification, which
                  would
                  be a practical approach for our experiments due to its cost-effectiveness.</p>

                  the factors involving the cost-effectiveness of our solution. Through this, we decided
                  <i>Escherichia coli</i> was the best host for our peptide production. She helped us look into our

                  <h5>THEIR INPUT</h5>We approached Dr. Mamatha Ballal on 2nd June 2022 to get solutions for our
                  research-based queries and information on the prevalence of vibriosis. Since vibriosis is a cause
                  of
                  concern in humans as well, her expertise area made her the most appropriate person
                  to reach out to. We learnt the symptoms and treatment methods of vibriosis in humans.
                  Additionally,
                  we gained more information on the pathogenicity and virulence of <i>V.
                    parahaemolyticus</i>. Commenting on the frequency of people suffering from vibriosis in our
                  locality, she mentioned that <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> is pervasive in people who consume
                  non-vegetarian food. According to her, the severity of the infection is majorly caused
                  due to poor sanitation and hygiene habits followed. Though vibriosis is a devastating disease, it
                  is
                  most commonly prevalent in rural areas as compared to urban areas. She mentioned that people
                  suffering from vibriosis usually suffer from diarrhoea which leads to higher chances of mortality,
                  especially among immunocompromised people. She gave her suggestions for reducing the risks
                  associated
                  with <i>Vibrio</i> spp. and also said that <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> is a common food pathogen.
                  She
                  mentioned how temperature change could also affect the pathogenicity factors of vibriosis. She
                  also
                  mentioned that stool samples are collected to analyse and detect vibriosis in humans. Furthermore,
                  she elaborated on the culture-based methods for <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i>—i.e., using blood agar
                  and nutrient agar.</p>

                  <h5>THEIR INPUT</h5> We had our second interaction with Dr. Ramesh on 28th June 2022 to discuss
                  the
                  structure
                  prediction of MAM7. We explained the adhesion mechanism and how we used ClusPro for docking. To
                  design our peptide at this stage, we tried to integrate the concept of peptidomimetics. He
                  mentioned that fibronectin is the apparent binding site with five repeating units, and the
                  repeating
                  modules are used for the initial peptide design. Dr. Ramesh suggested that we could use a
                  computational alanine scan to refine the binding sites and molecular dynamic simulations. If the
                  receptor is prominent, we cannot do it on the 40 amino acids and would have find the local binding
                  regions. To inhibit the reaction, the five continuous domains of MAM7 are required to interact. In
                  this case, the peptide acts as an inhibitor, and the peptide docking is done on the receptor. If
                  the
                  receptor is big, a hypothesis should be formulated that interacts with MAM7. The model can be
                  verified by profiling the interaction. The relevant residues can be docked by using only specific
                  residues and changing the others. Furthermore, he elaborated that five or six types of amino acids
                  are required, and all 20 amino acids need not be required. He further elaborated more on the Build
                  option in Pymol that could be used for visualising the protein structure.</p>

                  <h5>THEIR INPUT</h5> We approached Dr. Kannan on 3rd July 2022 to get information on the effect of
                  vibriosis on human beings. Based on his research, he indicated that vibriosis involves a sporadic
                  outbreak that is not as prevalent in urban areas since they consume filtered water. With many
                  years
                  of experience, he mentioned that an epidemic is more noticeable around river bed regions due to
                  direct river water consumption and spreads as a communicable disease.
                  The severity of these infections is often treatable by following the appropriate hydration
                  measures
                  as the patients are observed for an incubation period of three days for the development of any
                  symptoms like vomiting, loose motions, or rice water diarrhoea. According to him, the major source
                  of vibriosis infection in humans is untreated water. Furthermore, he mentioned that vaccines are
                  administered to reduce a local epidemic risk. However, he also mentioned that often, vaccines
                  don't
                  find their way to rural areas, leading to large-scale epidemics that could be lethal beyond a
                  point.

                  Brackishwater Research (ICAR- CIBA) institute located in Chennai on 8th July 2022. Dr. M Shashi
                  Shekar
                  and his team consisting of Dr. Ashok, Dr. Raymond, Dr. Sujeet and Dr. Patil who were working on
                  the
                  prevalence of vibriosis in fish. We felt that the information they had would benefit our project’s
                  geographical statistics and research-related data. There was a brief discussion about the types of
                  projects they were working on for the research-oriented communities and looking for potential
                  areas
                  in which they could assist us with. Dr. Shashi Shekar introduced us to his lab and his team which
                  would help us in the future with our project.</p>

                  of our peptide and the disease. Furthermore, they also gave data on the products they manufactured
                  and their current ongoing research. They also provided specific lab protocols that were useful for
                  our future implementation. After this meeting, we decided to have another meeting with them to
                  further exchange data on the research carried out.

                  who discussed our dry lab aspects. Dr. Raymond, who holds good knowledge of aquaculture
                  operations,
                  helped us gather the parameters necessary for the fish tank dimensions. Likewise, Dr. Patil and
                  Dr.
                  Sujeet were the two microbiologists who helped us collect data for our research. They provided
                  relevant data about the various bacteria present in <i>Vibrio</i> species that affect fish and
                  shrimps. We further interacted with them about the various other bacterial and viral diseases that
                  cause economic losses to the fisherfolk. They provided more data on parameters, such as pH value
                  range and ammonia concentration that are to be maintained to prevent such outbreaks of diseases in
                  the fish farm. Furthermore, they appreciated our idea of targeting initial adhesion and discussed

                  <h5>THEIR INPUT</h5> We interacted with Dr. Manickam on 12th August 2022, to receive inputs on the
                  economic viability and large-scale production of our peptide. He was impressed with our usage of
                  chitosan nanoparticles as a delivery system since it is a natural polymer with immunomodulatory
                  properties and is biodegradable, too. He suggested that we increment the length of our peptide
                  that
                  would help boost our large-scale production. Through this, the purification cost would decrease
                  and
                  the ideal stability conditions and formulation required for the same would be at a more convenient
                  level. This drastically decreases the volume, making our solution more convenient for biological
                  maintenance. He mentioned that the current methods include the biological-based drugs and proteins
                  that are orally administered to animals. On the aspects of bioavailability, the carriers or
                  linkers
                  do not have that much of an impact at a particular site. With regards to the shelf-life of storing
                  the peptide, he suggested that it could be in the form or texture of salt which has durability for
                  almost a week. Towards the end, he suggested focusing on the ethical issues associated with the
                  disposal of the residue, if any, in the environment and also highlighting the impact being visible
                  on human beings, the end consumers of the food chain.</p>

                  techniques. This helped us formulate the best fit peptide production using a synthetic approach.
                  It
                  also made us consider the peptide stability condition through salt formation at room temperature
                  or
                  an elevated temperature.

                  <h5>THEIR INPUT</h5>We visited Aquatic Biosystems in Mangalore, owned by Mr. Ronald D’Souza on
                  22nd
                  August 2022. He set up Aquatic Biosystems in 2006, which is currently the largest ornamental fish
                  farm in
                  the state of Karnataka and the country’s most scientifically developed ornamental fish farm. He
                  explained his journey of setting up the farm and why he chose to use intensive systems, despite
                  the
                  general preference of using extensive methods for traditional fish farming. He conducts imports
                  and
                  exports from countries like Germany and Netherlands. He mentioned the procedures involved in the
                  Recirculatory Aquaculture System (RAS) filter system for aeration using filters. However, a common
                  problem their farm faces is the slow stream of water due to electric power issues in India. The
                  general protocol they follow involves quarantining the fish to identify and prevent any diseases
                  in
                  the hatchery for the breeding methods. Additionally, he mentioned that 5 grams per 100 litres of
                  tetracycline is added to the farming unit. The feed added includes fresh blanched meat and dry
                  granular feed. Fish feeding schedule at the larval stage is five times per day, and in the adult
                  stage, the fish are fed two times per day. The monsoon season enhances the production rate with
                  higher export value, simultaneously increasing susceptibility to diseases. The optimum pH
                  maintained
                  in their breeding unit ranges from 6.5 to 7.2. In case of any increased pH condition, alum is
                  added
                  to balance it out, and in case of any decreased pH range, the oyster shells are utilised as a
                  buffer.

                  <h5>OUR INFERENCE</h5>
                  We were delighted to observe the application of filters in the fish farm. This gave us the
                  confidence to propose a future implementation of our project in the form of a mesh that the inlet
                  of
                  the fish tank would be subjected to. The parameters provided by him formed a basis for our factors
                  into consideration when searching for an appropriate delivery mechanism.

                  We were pleasantly surprised by the immediate conceptual grasp he exhibited regarding our project.
                  We incurred valuable insight on the various aspects of biosafety, good lab practices and
                  biosecurity
                  that play a crucial role in the field of synthetic biology. Given his area of expertise, he
                  questioned the gravity of our problem. This helped us string our research-work toward a more

                  <h5>THEIR INPUT</h5>We interacted with Dr. Vinod Jyothikumar on 28th September 2022 to receive
                  inputs on
                  the biosafety aspects associated with our project and how we have integrated synthetic biology
                  aspects to make it a viable practical application. He suggested we use PubMed graphs for tracking
                  the horizontal transfer of pathogenicity of the <i>Vibrio</i> species which turned out to be
                  milder.
                  Since <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> is an important human pathogen according to WHO
                  guidelines, Dr. Vinod suggested we analyse the risk assessment factors associated with it. We
                  mentioned that for further testing, since our project involves a BSL2 pathogen, our approach is to
                  express Multivalent Adhesion Molecule 7 (MAM7) in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. He highlighted the
                  biochemistry and biophysics aspects involved in making our peptide more commercially realistic
                  </p>
                  <p class="reveal-on-scroll">He spoke about how we could include a visual signal for our binding by
                    making use of a GFP. He
                    asked us about the parameters that affect the pathogenicity of <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>,
                    such that we could derive an ideal condition that renders this bacteria harmless. For the
                    His-tag
                    pull-down mechanism, he spoke about using quantum dots with Nickel coating. These conditions can
                    include yellow or green wavelength along with Nickel, and once the carrier is ready, it could be
                    treated in the lab to observe the quantum dots under the slide microscope where it glows. He
                    urged
                    us to include a visual proof of the MAM7 and peptide interaction. The major application of
                    visualising, would involve methods of integration of quantum dots. </p>

                  to
                  our project for the binding. As seafood is a major staple diet of South-East tropical parts of
                  Asia,
                  Dr. Vinod's suggestions assisted us in browsing through how its effects in the market considering
