      <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>The Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean all encircle the Indian subcontinent to its east,
        west,
        and south, respectively. For this reason, India is a peninsular country, and fish has become a constituent of
        the
        staple diet in most parts of the Indian subcontinent. The field of synthetic biology is relatively new in
        science
        and engineering. This novel science faces problems concerning iregulation, social acceptance, and ethics.
        Through
        the months, our approach involved various communities in the conversation about the field and its applications.
        Our
        team tried to appeal to a wide range of people, including the elderly and the young. Furthermore, we focused on
        building cognisance about vibriosis and AMPifin. For our range of interactions, we were fortunate enough to
        connect
        with a few schools, communities and universities in and around the Indian states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and
        Telangana.</p>

      <p>We created and used educational, outreach, and science communication-based material on synthetic biology. As
        part
        of this, we expounded and discussed the rudimentary aspects of synthetic biology and iGEM to various target
        audiences through our interactions with the working class population, undergraduate, high school, middle school,
        and
        differently-abled students. To do so, we modified our materials according to every group’s capabilities and
        prepared
        different activities for them. We spoke to them about other aspects of molecular biology, synthetic biology and
        our
        project.</p>

      <h1>Orientations and Activities</h1>

      <p>India’s educational course structure primarily focuses on theoretical and computational learning. Due to this,
        pure
        science courses are sidelined. Through our education and communication, our objective was to introduce new
        topics to
        these school students and help them venture through more interests and career opportunities than common topics.
        In
        order to do this, we decided to approach students of different age groups and in various schools.</p>

      <h2>Amalgamating Biology and Engineering</h2>

      <p>According to the present Indian curriculum, higher secondary students are split into different branches—science
        with biology, science without biology, commerce, and humanities. Consequently, senior secondary is the age at
        which
        students need to choose their probable majors for university, and it is an important year for them. Other than
        the
        mainstream courses, we wanted to introduce them to the versatile and developing field of biology and
        engineering.
      </p>

      <p>On July 9th 2022, we visited Shantiniketan School, where we elucidated the integration of biology in
        engineering.
        to over two hundred students. Since our session was focused on <b>secondary students</b>, the orientation began with an
        introduction to molecular biology and genetics. This included some basic concepts on genes, nucleotides and,
        eventually, the different codons and their functions. After explaining the basics of synthetic biology, we moved
        her
        focus toward AMPifin and its applications. The session concluded with a small activity using the codon chart.
        The
        students were given a few random sequences to decipher using the codon chart to solve a mystery. Everyone took
        part
        in this with great enthusiasm!</p>

      <p>In the following days, many teachers and students approached our team members about the contents of our
        presentation with numerous different follow-up questions. They shared snapshots of the event to help engage
        their
        readers on the activities of our session we conducted and about how it helped the students and faculty members.

      <h2>Synthetic Biology, an Oxymoron?</h2>

      <p>On 19th July 2022, we visited CHIREC International School to educate <b>higher secondary students</b> on the various career opportunities synthetic biology and genetic engineering hold.</p>

      <p>We interacted with over sixty students whose coursework was a mix of biology and science-based subjects. These
        students were enthusiastic about learning the applications of engineering biology and their amalgamation with
        synthetic biology. Since biology is mostly associated with all things natural, the concept of synthetic biology
        seemed quite contradictory to the students at first. We started by speaking about “the amazing genetic code”,
        and
        then spoke about the central dogma and its applications in engineering biology. Moreover, we explained the
        Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL) cycle approach through simple examples.</p>

      <p>Following this, we spoke about the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition and how
        students
        their age can take part through various simple ideas that focus on local problems. The students were exceedingly
        interested in AMPifin and asked our members numerous questions about our ideations and iterations for it. Many
        of
        the students were interested in career prospects of synthetic biology or biotechnology. Furthermore, we
        conducted a
        short codon-chart-based activity that the students took part in with great interest!</p>

      <p>Some of the teachers approached us to understand how they could guide their students towards new and upcoming
        fields in biology and engineering. The head of department of biotechnology even approached us a few days later
        to
        know more about how they could enroll CHIREC as an iGEM high school team!</p>

      <h2>School of Synthetic Biology</h2>

      <p>Madhav Kripa is a school that is located near our college premises. Being surrounded by several colleges, we
        felt
        that it would be beneficial to introduce its students to the diversified courses available in biology and engineering for higher studies. We
        decided to have an orientation on 7th October 2022 with the <b>secondary school students</b> at the school and educate
        them on the concepts of synthetic biology and foldscopes.</p>

      <p>Adding on to our previous educational initiatives, we began the session by teaching some basic molecular and
        synthetic biology concepts. We enlightened the learners on genes, nucleotides, codons and their functions.
        Furthermore, we introduced them to the history and timeline of synthetic biology—chemistry, biology, synthetic
        chemistry, and synthetic biology. Our team also spoke to them about synthetic biology's various applications,
        including diagnostics, therapeutics, agriculture, industry, energy, and bioremediation. After this, we
        distributed
        AMPifin’s DIY comic strip to the students there and asked them what they inferred from it. Many of them observed
        what we tried to communicate, and their answers were in tandem with AMPifin’s problem statement.</p>

      <p>After we explained our project to them, we spoke about a foldscope microscope. We showed them a foldscope
        microscope and how it works. Furthermore, the students were thoroughly engrossed and inmmersive. These students
        were enthusiastic and responded well to our questions and the session. After the session, a few of them asked us
        about how they could learn more concepts on synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Furthermore, the teachers
        and administrators at the school wanted us to conduct more such sessions for the students. Our team decided to
        make it a regular activity after our iGEM season.</p>

      <p>High school science majors often face confusion between choosing engineering or biological sciences. This is
        the
        point when biology and engineering frequently diverge, with one being seen as wholly exclusive. Through our
        visits, we helped instil awareness of the potential for combining biology and technology or the extent of this
        field. Furthermore, by interacting with a wider demographic, we brought cognisance to synthetic biology, its
        applications, and the opportunities it holds.</p>

      <h2>Synthetic Biology for Everyone</h2>

      <p>On many occasions, the differently-abled are excluded from the fields of science and technology. We believe
        that
        science is for everyone. To bring fruition to our beliefs, we decided to visit a rehabilitation centre and
        interact with the members at their home.</p>

      <p>On September 29th 2022, our team visited <b>Asare Rehabilitation Centre</b>—a home for the differently-abled. We
        began
        with a brief introduction to iGEM MIT_MAHE, and were introduced to the members at the home. To understand and
        interact with them in a better way, we engaged them in a musical performance. After this, we proceeded to enact
        a
        skit that explained our project idea to them. Here, we held placards to signify the key aspects of AMPifin—fish,
        <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, the MAM7 protein, a peptide, and chitosan nanoparticles. Through our skit, which
        was performed in their local language—Kannada, we were able to bring an understanding of AMPifin and synthetic
        biology. Following the skit, we organised a colouring activity based on assorted cliparts of fish. Through this
        visit, we understood that there are no barriers to understanding science, and their enthusiasm toward our
        initiative was enlivening!

      <h2>Synthetic Biology for Everyone—the Working-Class Audience</h2>

      <p>On September 18th 2022, we conducted an online webinar for the <b>working-class members</b>. These individuals,
        currently in their 35–60 year age group are the current representatives of the society, and therefore, we
        decided
        to hold a webinar that included the basics of synthetic biology and AMPifin. The attendees were from various
        fields and backgrounds, out of which, approximately 25% were well-versed in biotechnology and its principles.
        Our
        audience pool consisted of engineers, professors, chartered accountants, nurses, businessmen, scientists,
        teachers, to name a few.</p>

      <p>In spite of their expertise barriers, they listened to our idea with rapt attention. Throughout the
        presentation,
        they asked us questions on concepts that they were unfamiliar with. During the question and answer session, they
        asked us multiple questions that we hadn't considered. They encouraged us to continue our work post-iGEM, and
        improve on our current idea. This pushed us to discuss our future implementation and amalgamate our design with
        a
        commercially-viable solution. At the end of this meeting, all the members built an inquisitiveness toward
        synthetic biology and its applications. Furthermore, their various areas of expertise helped us build a certain
        holisticity to AMPifin.</p>

      <h2>Local People Solving Local Problems</h2>

      <p>To educate <b>university students</b> on synthetic biology and AMPifin, our team decided to hold an interactive and
        educational session in our university about biology and its relevance in engineering.</p>

      <p>The session consisted of two phases. During the first phase of this session, we spoke to them about biology and
        how it is integrated into engineering. We explained synthetic biology and iGEM. We then spoke to them about
        iGEM,
        and in tandem with that, we introduced them to AMPifin. At the end of this session, we split the attendees into
        groups and asked them to generate problem statements of their own. We explained that the solution to their
        chosen
        problem need not be perfect; however, it should reflect on the concept of local problems and effective synthetic
        biology-based solutions to them.</p>

      <p>A week later, we conducted the second phase of this session. Every team came up with unique and interesting
        problem statements. They presented their projects in exciting ways and were able to answer the audience’s
        questions. Their ideas brought in a versatile approach to solving local problems. By spreading the idea behind
        iGEM and synthetic biology, we aimed to inspire young scientists to address pressing issues. The students
        underwent a month-long training session that covered the fundamentals of synthetic biology before we asked them
        to
        string together project ideas. The initiative brought in an exhaustive understanding of the various aspects
        involved in picking a problem statement, understanding its impact, and generating cohesive solutions to them.
      </p>

      <p>The teams worked on simple solutions to their chosen problem statements. iGEM MIT_MAHE mentored them through
        the
        process, and ensured to interact with them at every stage of their work. Listed below are their problem
        statements</p>

      <ol>
        <li>How to reduce the thermal heat transfer that takes place in
          the air conditioning system which excessively contributes to global warming.</li>
        <li>Improve the viability of PGPRs in ginger fields and alleviate the need
          for harmful chemical fertilisers.</li>
        <li>Blocking the docking of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> on Reticulocytes. </li>
        <li>Addressing the issue of microplastic accumulation by using PETase enzyme from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>.</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Workshops</h1>

      <h2>Biology and Experimental Learning</h2>

      <p>A student’s interests develop at a young age. Therefore, it is important to expose the younger generation to
        the
        new fields in science and communication. We believe that this would help them build an interest in STEM-based
        subjects at a younger age, and understand science as a broad subject of study, too. For this reason, we decided
        to
        go to an elementary and middle school. </p>

      <p>We visited the Prajna English Medium School on 11th October 2022. Our team had the opportunity to interact
        with
        students of a wide age group band, including <b>elementary, primary, and secondary school children</b>. For the forty
        students, we began with a small introduction of our team members to the students, and proceeded to talk about
        basic biology and its integration with engineering. Furthermore, we distributed our DIY comic strip and
        explained
        our project idea to the students through the snippets of the comic.</p>

      <p>We invited Ms. Shyamala S Kunder, a member of the National Commission for Women, to emphasise the importance of
        educating young children, paving the way through enhancing the literacy rate of our country.</p>

      <p>The students were able to understand our project in simple terms through the comic strips. They were very
        reciprocative during the presentation and understood the importance of sustainable solutions in all aspects of
        life. Being young students, they also gained familiarity with new terms that they would come across after a few
        years. Furthermore, the teachers were keen on understanding AMPifin and explaining it to the students.</p>

              </figure>

      <h2>Microscope Workshop</h2>

      <p>The school we visited did not have access to microscopes or lab equipment. Therefore, we decided to introduce
        the school's students to basic lab equipment and their usage. To do this, we decided to hold a workshop on <b>microscopes and basic
        visualisation</b> using them. As part of the workshop, we explained to them the building of a microscope and their
        various applications in viewing organisms. Then, we helped them analyse samples of moss, cheek swabs, bacteria
        from a water body, and red blood cells. The students were thoroughly immersed in the activity, and participated
        with great enthusiasm. Through their observations, they deciphered the differences between the various cell
        structures and their functions.</p>

      <h2>Swab Testing Workshop</h2>

      <p>Through this workshop, we wanted to show the students the <b>importance of hygiene practices</b> and the amounts of germs
        that
        reside on their hands. We also wanted to give them a representation of how these germs appear on a microscopic
        level. The second activity we planned for them was a swab test of their palms. Before we started this activity,
        we
        spoke to these students about the importance of washing hands thoroughly, especially in recent times owing to
        the
        pandemic. For this, we took a few swab samples from their palm. After this, we asked the students to go and wash
        their hands very well with soap and hand sanitizer. We took samples after this. Then, we took these samples back
        to our university, where we tested the samples and communicated with the school teachers about the results we
        received. This was done to teach the students about the importance of washing their hands and following good
        personal hygiene practices. The students responded positively to our session and learnt about simple tests that
        can be performed. The aforementioned workshops have been elaborated on via the attachment </p>

      <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>It is true that comprehending scientific advancements is more significant than learning about the opportunities
        they open up. Synthetic biology is not an exception to this; without acceptance of the changes it brings,
        advancement would be meaningless. This was our attempt at communicating our vision and values to diverse
        audiences
        through different teaching methods.</p>

      <h2>Webinars</h2>

        <h3>Waterborne Pathogens</h3>

      <p>In collaboration with Queen’s iGEM, we hosted a webinar on <b>waterborne pathogens</b>. Since our project, AMPifin, is
        associated with <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, we wanted to spread awareness on various bacteria, viruses, and
        other pathogens that live in water. Our speakers—Dr. Mamatha Ballal and Dr. Cecilia Gimenez—both extremely
        proficient academicians in their respective fields, set the stage by discussing infectious diseases, waterborne
        pathogens, and the importance of clean water across all localities. The webinar saw over sixty attendees from
        across the regions of Canada and India, including university students and scholars. Furthermore, in the Question
        and Answer portion of the seminar, the audience picked up engaging discussion points. They asked the speakers
        about their work, and interlinked these aspects with the webinar’s topic. Furthermore, they were inquisitive
        about
        the various methods of detection of these pathogens, and the speakers elaborated on all aspects of the
        questions.

      <h3>Entrepreneurship in Bioremediation and Aquaculture</h3>

      <p>In collaboration with Queen’s iGEM, we hosted a talk on the different <b>synthetic-biology-based entrepreneurial
        techniques in bioremediation and aquaculture</b>. Sandra Dworatzek, a principal scientist at SiREM Canada, discussed
        her current outline of work in the field. The webinar saw over thirty attendees from across the regions of
        Canada
        and India, including university students and scholars. She elaborated on how the various techniques can be
        integrated through aspects like entrepreneurship and product development with iGEM teams like ours. Furthermore,
        in the Question and Answer portion of the seminar, the audience picked up engaging discussion points. They asked
        the speaker about their work, and interlinked these aspects with the webinar's topic.

      <h3>Biosafety in Synthetic Biology</h3>

      <p>To communicate with a wider audience on the <b>importance of biosafety in synthetic biology</b> we hosted a webinar in
        partnership with iGEM IISER Pune II. This webinar aimed to make the general audience aware of the essential
        biosafety measures to be followed while working with synthetic biology in the real world.</p>

      <p>We invited Dr. Vinod Jyothikumar to deliver this presentation. He received his PhD in Pharmaceutical and
        Biomedical Sciences from Strathclyde University, Glasgow, UK, in 2010 and post-doctoral experience from the
        University of Guelph, Canada—in 2011. He has executed various safety projects within research laboratories
        across
        reputed academic institutions in Europe, the US, and industry settings. It was an extremely interactive and
        insightful experience. The audience learnt about biosafety practices, dual research use, basic lab protocols and
        their imperativeness in any workspace, and legal regulations that follow any project. The participants also had
        many questions and clarified their doubts and misconceptions of the topic in the question and answer session.
        Through this session, we were able to set the stage on the imperativeness of safety in all experiments, and how
        it
        integrates itself in any field of work. To know more about this webinar, visit our <a

      <h2>Pamphlet on Antibiotics in Aquaculture Industries</h2>

      <p>India is the second-largest producer of seafood in the world. Udupi, Manipal, and Mangalore contribute to this
        production significantly. As our project is based on the pisciculture industry, our major stakeholders are fish
        farmers and hatchery owners.</p>

      <p>For this reason, team AMPifin decided to research the previously used methods of prevention, and we discovered
        that antibiotics are used as a broad-spectrum solution. Additionally, small-scale fish farms or hatchery owners
        don’t send infected samples to the lab for detection. These fish are directly treated with common antibiotics or
        other methods. Since antibiotics are most commonly misused in this field, we decided to work on a pamphlet on
        the
        safe usage of antibiotics.</p>

      <p>In the pamphlet, we included the common but often overlooked guidelines on their usage. We also included a few
        precautions farmers, and hatchery owners should follow to get a healthy yield of produce for a long time. To
        improve our pamphlet’s reach and readability, we distributed it to various communities while ensuring that they
        were printed in their <b>regional languages</b>—i.e. English, Kannada, and Tamil. We distributed them at the various
        fish
        farms and hatcheries across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Dubai. These pamphlets were well-appreciated and
        educational. The farmers who received the pamphlets were glad to incorporate the guidelines in their day-to-day
        operation. These pamphlets have been attached below</p>

      <h2>Podcast with The Astronomy Club, Manipal.</h2>

      <p>On 7th October, 2022, we collaborated with the Astronomy Club, Manipal to talk about synthetic biology and its
        applications in the space industry. The podcast comprised two members of the Astronomy Club and two members of
        Manipal BioMachines. The podcast started off with an introduction to the respective members and iGEM. The
        discussion was based on how synthetic biology could be used to enhance and use the extreme environments of space
        to our advantage. For example—extremophiles for the elimination of biowaste and synthesis of biomaterial, self
        healing bio-compounds for integrity of the space shuttle, nutrient-rich-space-conserving food. There were talks
        about previous iGEM teams’ projects that built on the motive of improving space travel quality for the
        travellers
        by integrating pure synthetic biology-based components.</p>

      <p>This podcast was an opportunity for us to help include all those interested in astronomy to synthetic biology.
        It
        was also a learning opportunity for our team since we were able to speak to astrophiles. This helped us
        understand
        the areas of intersection between synthetic biology and astronomy. To check the audio, visit our <a href="https://2022.igem.wiki/mit-mahe/collaborations">collaboration</a> page!</p>

    

      <h2>DIY Comic Strip</h2>

      <p>To foster interest in synthetic biology and biotechnology in children, we decided to create a comic book. The
        theme of this comic book is based on our project—AMPifin. Through this comic strip, we aim to teach the younger
        generation that biology is not a niche subject and that synthetic biology is an interesting field to study and
        work in. In this comic strip, we follow a fish called Juno and its underwater adventures as it learns about the
        pathogen—<i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, and the disease caused by it—i.e., vibriosis. Furthermore, we
        distributed
        this comic strip to children and students across our locality, and they thoroughly enjoyed reading it! Below is
        a
        digital version of our strip</p>

     <h2>Ethics Round Table</h2>

      <p>Our college, Manipal Institute of Technology, currently has seventeen student projects. To broaden our dialogue
        on AMPifin, we decided to talk to members of various interdisciplinary projects about the ethical aspects of our
        project, and synthetic biology at large. For this—i.e., the Ethics Roundtable, on 22nd September 2022, we
        invited
        members from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rugved_systems/">R.U.G.V.E.D Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/formulamanipal/">Formula Manipal</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/project.manas/">Project Manas</a> , <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thrustmit/">Thrust MIT</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/swarmrobotics/">SWARM Robotics</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/teammanipalracing/">Team Manipal
        Racing </a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aeromitofficial/">Aero MIT</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/project.dronaid/">Project Dronaid</a>.</p>

      <p>We urged them to talk about the safety protocols they followed through their projects that fall under various
        engineering subjects like mechanics, electronics, computer science and artificial intelligence, to name a few.
        We
        began by simply elucidating on AMPifin, keeping in mind their scientific background. After this, we asked every
        student to explain their projects. As the ethics roundtable progressed, we asked them about the safety protocols
        they follow at their workspaces, and we elaborated on our lab safety protocols.</p>

      <p>Through this, we establish the imperativeness of safety protocols in any experimental setup. We asked them what
        they thought might be the safety issues associated with our project and their interpretation of any safety
        measures we could implement. The discussion panel shifted toward an enthusiastic dialogue on their
        interpretation
        of biosafety issues, and it helped us perceive the general opinion on synthetic biology-based projects. They
        also
        asked us questions based on the general idea behind synthetic biology and what it involves. Furthermore, we
        explained the concept of genetic engineering and its ethical concerns. The interaction was extremely fruitful as
        the raised points brought a better understanding of synthetic biology for a wider community. Additionally, it
        created room for numerous interdisciplinary aspects that we could explore.</p>

      <h2>Geo Book</h2>

      <p>In the spirit of sharing and understanding seafood within the context of different cuisines and localities,
        MIT_MAHE’s iGEM team decided to collaborate on a compendium of dishes that involve aquatic animals.</p>

      <p>The main aim of the Geo Book was to celebrate diversity and bring more recognition to what affects our
        favourite
        palates of seafood. Furthermore, it brought light to any unsustainable practices involved in their breeding. All
        the participating teams included details and photographs of their favourite kinds of seafood, and our team
        compiled them for inquisitive readers, and of course, seafood connoisseurs!</p>

        <p>The Geo Book was designed to help the general public understand the various topics that are associated with seafoods. The teams that participated were iGEM REC Chennai, iGEM IISER Pune II, iGEM Chalmers_Gothenburg, iGEM William
        and
        Mary, iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania 2022, iGEM HKUST, iGEM Pinene Express, iGEM TecCEM, iGEM Queens_Canada. To view the
