<p>In many instances, specific bands of our community are excluded from the STEM and synthetic biology conversation.To
    educate and communicate with a wider audience, our primary goal was to reach out to various age groups. While doing
    so, we incorporated various activity-based sections in all our visits. These components were designed for specific
    age groups of the society, as well as our primary and secondary stakeholders. Aspects like a podcast, comic strips,
    and pamphlets were simple components we used as connectors between us and the general public. Our interactions not
    only facilitated spreading cognisance on synthetic biology, buy also served as a learning platform for our team
    members.</p>
