<h1>Cloning and Expression System </h1>

<p>For our experimentation, expression of MAM7 was done by using our chassis– <i>E.coli</i> BL21 and the vector
  pET-22b(+).</p>

<p>With our progress in the project, our Wet Lab geared up on a detailed itinerary of planned experiments. This curated
  handbook includes various experiments like plasmid isolation, competent cell preparation, Ni-NTA column
  chromatography, etc. The primary objective is to help other iGEM teams carry out these recombinant experiments and
  provide them with the opportunity to improve their current experimental designs.</p>

<h1>Experimentation Timeline</h1>
<div class="row">
  <p>With our progress in the project, our Wet Lab geared up on a detailed itinerary of experiments ready to go ahead
    with. Unfortunately due to lack of time we could not execute the lab work as planned. This page consists of our
    experimentation handbook and a lab bulletin that summarises our journey so far in the lab. We curated a handbook
    such that anyone could refer to it in order to gain a better understanding of our experimentation itinerary. In case
    anyone happens to pick a project in the same trajectory as ours, this could serve as a guide for them. This handbook
    has a variety of experiments that we have performed and plan on performing further like—plasmid isolation, peptide
    purification, etc. Despite our iGEM season coming to an end soon enough, we intend to try to continue our
    experimentation.</p>
  <p>Here's our week wise experimentation timeline!</p>

<h1>Biosafety</h1>
<p>Given the conversations we had with the experts in domains like Biosafety and Biosecurity, we decided to not work
  with the risk-2 organism <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>. Instead, we decided on expressing our target protein– MAM7 in
  our chassis– <i>E.coli</i> and performing further experiments with it. Here we are making use of the truncated version
  of MAM7, lacking the first 44 amino acids which are required for its membrane localization in its pathogenic origin.
  Thereby the modified MAM7, when heterologously expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, will not be able to mediate any
  harmful effects. This allowed us to avoid the risks of disease transmission to human beings and environmental
  dissemination, while complying with the laws and regulations of recombinant research provided by the university. </p>

<p>Further, in order to gain some on-sight experience, we visited Dr. Mamatha Ballal’s lab i.e., the Enteric Diseases
  Division. Here we were provided with the opportunity to witness the culturing and maintenance of <i>Vibrio
    parahaemolyticus</i> stocks in a supervised environment.</p>
