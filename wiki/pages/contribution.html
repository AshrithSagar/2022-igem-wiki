<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Through the course of our project, we came across many avenues where there are tasks that can be optimized or are
  cumbersome due to limitations in tools or awareness. Identifying these avenues and working on them to resolve these
  issues for further iGEMers has been a long-developed culture cultivated in all iGEM teams. Over our iGEM journey, we
  identified gaps that other teams might run into, thereby slowing their progress, and decided to address these gaps
  with the following.</p>

<h1>Experimentation Handbook</h1>

<p>With our progress in the project, our Wet Lab geared up on a detailed itinerary of planned experiments. This curated
  handbook includes various experiments like plasmid isolation, competent cell preparation, Ni-NTA column
  chromatography, etc. The primary objective is to help other iGEM teams carry out these recombinant experiments and
  provide them with the opportunity to improve their current experimental designs.</p>

<h1>Software</h1>

<p>Our software GRASP, addresses the unavailability of reliable softwares that consider conformational changes while
  performing conserved mutations to a peptide sequence. Thus, GRASP is a unique tool that would help future iGEM teams
  perform conserved point mutations at respective sites. This software would help future iGEM teams by simplifying the
  creation of appropriate conserved mutations to their corresponding sequence.</p>

<h1>Handbook on Protein Docking Servers</h1>

<p>The multitude of available tools to simulate Protein-Protein interactions and structure predictions, howsoever
  useful,
  comes with the added cost of not knowing which tool to use when and where. Our team faced the aforementioned issues
  when
  docking studies were carried out. On talking to other iGEM teams, IISER Pune 2 reported that they faced similar
  problems. This common ground of confusion led to the urge to ease the process of choosing a relevant tool from the
  array
  of available tools for upcoming iGEMers. In this handbook, we have compiled the algorithm and use cases of popular
  docking servers, along with an overview of Rigid and Flexible Docking while highlighting ClusPro and HADDOCK. We have
  also briefly gone over AlphaFold and ColabFold for the prediction of protein structures.</p>
