  <p>Collaboration bolsters the essence of iGEM, and in tandem with that, we pushed to collaborate with various iGEM
    teams worldwide. Through our multiple interactions with iGEM teams worldwide, we built a better understanding of the
    projects around us. Furthermore, we gained insight and feedback on our approach, and helped other teams with their
    troubleshooting aspects. Our collaborations brought in an all-encompassing view of iGEM and the multitude of teams
    participating in the competition. We thank the community of students with whom we were fortunate enough to interact.

  <h2>Webinars in collaboration with iGEM Queens_Canada</h2>

  <p>We collaborated with iGEM Queens_Canada through webinars to build on both teams' knowledge of waterborne pathogens.
    Furthermore, these webinars touched on important topics like entrepreneurship and developing processes in
    bioremediation and aquaculture.</p>

  <p>Our first interaction with<a href= "https://2022.igem.wiki/queens-canada/">iGEM Queens_Canada</a> was in May 2022. We began by explaining our projects to each other
    and looking at possible collaboration and fruitful work areas. The Queens iGEM team told us that the necessity for
    effective filtration and detection technology has become critical due to the persistent problem of unsafe drinking
    water in indigenous communities across Canada. Their objective is to offer these communities a point-of-care water
    filtration system that will remove harmful chemicals like lead, mercury, and <i>E. coli</i> and assist them in
    identifying undesired microorganisms in their water to ensure it is safe to drink. Our project for 2022 focuses on
    synthesising a novel antimicrobial peptide that can bind to the protein MAM7 on the bacteria, thus preventing
    infection. On interacting with their team, we troubleshot ideas based on our project. We decided to collaborate on
    spreading awareness and promoting discussion based on waterborne pathogens and synthetic-biology-based techniques
    that have paved the way to finding solutions to these problems.</p>

  <p>Our first webinar, held on 14th August, 2022, was based on an exciting set of talks on the different bacteria,
    viruses, and other pathogens that live in water. Our speakers—Dr. Mamatha Ballal and Dr. Cecilia Gimenez—both
    extremely proficient academicians in their respective fields, set the stage by discussing infectious diseases,
    waterborne pathogens, and the importance of clean water across all localities. The webinar saw over sixty attendees
    from across the regions of Canada and India, including university students and scholars. Furthermore, in the
    Question and Answer portion of the seminar, the audience picked up engaging discussion points. They asked the
    speakers about their work, and interlinked these aspects with the webinar’s topic.</p>

  <p>Our second webinar, held on 15th September, 2022, was based on a talk on developing different
    synthetic-biology-based entrepreneurial techniques in bioremediation and aquaculture. Sandra Dworatzek, a principal
    scientist at SiREM Canada, discussed her current outline of work in the field. The webinar saw over thirty attendees
    from across the regions of Canada and India, including university students and scholars. She elaborated on how the
    various techniques can be integrated through aspects like entrepreneurship and product development with iGEM teams
    like ours. Furthermore, in the Question and Answer portion of the seminar, the audience picked up engaging
    discussion points. They asked the speaker about their work, and interlinked these aspects with the webinar's topic.

  <h2>Troubleshooting and Human Practices insights with HKUST iGEM</h2>

  <p>We collaborated on numerous topics that involved corroboration between the teams in troubleshooting and building on
    our existing knowledge of the projects. Furthermore, we identified common stakeholders and helped each other analyse
    and approach the pisciculture markets in India and Hongkong, respectively.</p>

  <p>Our first meeting with the <a href="https://2022.igem.wiki/hkust/">iGEM HKUST</a> team was on 5th July, 2022, during which both teams presented their project
    ideas and looked for potential areas of collaboration. Upon identifying possible similarities in the IHP aspect
    (since both teams are working with the seafood industry in our respective geographies) and dry lab, these seemed the
    most feasible areas for collaboration.</p>

  *insert HKUST meeting photo*
  <i>A snapshot from our first interaction with iGEM HKUST.</i>

  <p>The initial meeting inspired us to widen our approach toward IHP stakeholder research and conduct more extensive
    research into the Indian seafood market. Based on their input, we initiated interactions with the seafood market and
    restaurant workers across our locality. To facilitate the exchange of stakeholder contacts, the integrated human
    practices modules from both teams had additional meetings informally. We presented insights from our research and
    experience with India’s pisciculture industry. We also provided them with contact details and information on a few
    fish farms and markets in India.</p>

  <p>After meeting with the entire team prior, the dry lab modules from each team hosted a second meeting to discuss
    matters related to mathematical modelling. In particular, the iGEM HKUST team wanted to discuss more stochastic
    protein and promoter interaction modelling. Our team shared information on the software we used and some details on
    navigating them. The softwares included BUDE Alanine scan, ClusPro (for molecular docking), and Schrodinger Maestro
    (visualisation). Furthermore, iGEM HKUST provided our team with information on constructing the ODEs and the
    interpretational methods to generate meaningful graphs from the ODEs.</p>

  <h2>Handbook on Biology and Engineering with iGEM VIT Vellore</h2>

  <p>We had our first interaction with <a href="https://2022.igem.wiki/vit-vellore">iGEM VIT Vellore</a> while collating on the organisational aspects of the All India
    iGEM Meet. Eleven Indian teams competing in iGEM 2022 attended the immersive three-day meet with activities ranging
    from project presentations to engrossing seminars on the various aspects of Synthetic biology.</p>

  <p>After this, our teams decided to collaborate on a handbook that elucidates the integration between biology and
    engineering for the use of educators. We included aspects like an introduction to genes and genetics, the central
    dogma, and basic examples to explain synthetic biology and biomimetics. We also added a section on iGEM High School
    teams. Through this collaboration, our teams understood the importance of broadening our reach toward young
    students; students who are at their initial stage of learning and understanding STEM backgrounds. Below is an
    attachment of the handbook</p>

  <h2>Video on safe lab practices</h2>
  <p>On collaborating with iGEM IISER Mohali on a short video and write-up that elucidated essential lab practices, our
    team’s members reiterated the importance of following protocols in a lab. It is crucial to comprehend the
    significance of lab safety because laboratories provide a wide variety of safety risks. We realised that our team
    could aid in preventing or eliminating hazards by being familiar with our laboratory and adhering to the lab safety
    protocols. The video and write-up included personal protective equipment, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, proper
    waste disposal methods, and aseptic techniques. Below is our documentation for the protocols.</p>

  <h2>Bacteria book</h2>
  <p>Through AMPifin, we aim to target <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, one of the most prevalent bacteria involved in
    spreading the vibriosis disease in fish. On seeing the Bacteria Book initiative of iGEM McGill, iGEM Queen’s, iGEM
    Cornell, and iGEM Costa Rica, we decided to add information on <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i>. The bacteria book would
    be a great reading experience for the general public that is curious to know more about the world of bacteria and
    pathogens.</p>

  <h2>World Dengue Day</h2>

  <p>As an initiative for World Dengue Day, we recorded a video to spread awareness of Dengue for compilation by iGEM
    IISER Pune II. Their novel approach to spreading cognisance instilled a sense of responsibility among our members,
    and we ensured to communicate their inference to all our members. To view the video, check out iGEM IISER Mohali’s
    wiki!</p>

  <h2>MSP-Maastricht Quiz</h2>

  <p>As an initiative by MSP-Maastricht to introduce children and the elderly to synthetic biology, the team decided to
    create a puzzle book, including projects of fellow iGEM teams. Here, we collaborated by providing them with
    information and keywords associated best with AMPifin. The puzzle book helped raise familiarity with synthetic
    biology and its related work.</p>

  <h2>Podcast with The Astronomy Club, Manipal.</h2>
  <p>On 7th October, 2022, we collaborated with the Astronomy Club, Manipal to talk about synthetic biology and its
    applications in the space industry. The podcast comprised two members of the Astronomy Club and two members of
    Manipal BioMachines. The podcast started off with an introduction to the respective members and iGEM. The discussion
    was based on how synthetic biology could be used to enhance and use the extreme environments of space to our
    advantage. For example—extremophiles for the elimination of biowaste and synthesis of biomaterial, self healing
    bio-compounds for integrity of the space shuttle, nutrient-rich-space-conserving food. There were talks about
    previous iGEM teams’ projects that built on the motive of improving space travel quality for the travellers by
    integrating pure syn-bio based components. The audio to this podcast has been attached below</p>

  <p>This podcast was an opportunity for us to collaborate with astrophiles and understand their areas of interest.
    Discussing how astronomy integrates itself with astrology and astrobiology was an intriguing experience for our
    teams!</p>
